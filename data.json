    "Abstract": "This paper evaluates several Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) processes, an integrated sludge management system, and waste sludge disposal methods in a large city based on life cycle analysis (LCA) and economic efficiency analysis (EEA) together. Among the three WWTP processes considered, the A2O process (S-WWTP) showed the lowest eutrophication potential (EP) and global warming potential (GWP), but the highest acidification potential (AP) and human toxicity potential (HTP). Simple integration of sludge treatment by combining two sludge treatment lines resulted in enhanced anaerobic digestion and production of less sludge. For final sludge disposal, incineration with integrated sludge management showed the highest reduction of life cycle impact analysis (LCIA) in all four categories. The simple integration of sludge management could reduce the sludge handling cost by 6.1%. As a final sludge disposal method, incineration with integration of sludge management was the most economic: reducing operation and management (O&M) cost by 33%. These results demonstrated that application of LCA and EEA would be a useful tool for optimizing an integrated sludge-management system. The proposed integrated sludge-management alternatives could provide a valuable example for managing several WWTPs in a large city.",

    "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have drawn increasing concern due to their widespread presence and persistence in the environment. In contrast, methods and manuals have been developed only recently to provide recommended analysis procedures for a growing list of selected PFASs, with more quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) measures incorporated to ensure data robustness. This review examined studies on the environmental occurrence of PFASs in different water systems in the United States (US) along with similar studies in the other countries. The review has thus revealed a few patterns regarding the environmental occurrence of PFASs having different molecular features, the impact of possible upstream PFAS sources, and the effects of water treatment facilities. Further research is needed to analyze a wider array of PFASs, particularly those playing roles in PFAS degradation pathways. The review also indicates a need for technologies capable of destructing PFASs in addition to those separation processes currently implemented at water treatment facilities to mitigate the environmental presence of PFASs.",

    "Abstract": "The stability and resilience of the Earth system and human well-being are inseparably linked1–3, yet their interdependencies are generally under-recognized; consequently, they are often treated independently4,5. Here, we use modelling and literature assessment to quantify safe and just Earth system boundaries (ESBs) for climate, the biosphere, water and nutrient cycles, and aerosols at global and subglobal scales. We propose ESBs for maintaining the resilience and stability of the Earth system (safe ESBs) and minimizing exposure to significant harm to humans from Earth system change (a necessary but not sufficient condition for justice)4. The stricter of the safe or just boundaries sets the integrated safe and just ESB. Our findings show that justice considerations constrain the integrated ESBs more than safety considerations for climate and atmospheric aerosol loading. Seven of eight globally quantified safe and just ESBs and at least two regional safe and just ESBs in over half of global land area are already exceeded. We propose that our assessment provides a quantitative foundation for safeguarding the global commons for all people now and into the future.",

    "Abstract": "Keeping the Earth system in a stable and resilient state, to safeguard Earth's life support systems while ensuring that Earth's benefits, risks, and related responsibilities are equitably shared, constitutes the grand challenge for human development in the Anthropocene. Here, we describe a framework that the recently formed Earth Commission will use to define and quantify target ranges for a “safe and just corridor” that meets these goals. Although “safe” and “just” Earth system targets are interrelated, we see safe as primarily referring to a stable Earth system and just targets as being associated with meeting human needs and reducing exposure to risks. To align safe and just dimensions, we propose to address the equity dimensions of each safe target for Earth system regulating systems and processes. The more stringent of the safe or just target ranges then defines the corridor. Identifying levers of social transformation aimed at meeting the safe and just targets and challenges associated with translating the corridor to actors at multiple scales present scope for future work.",

Continuing to overlook the vast majority of other PFASs is a major concern for society. We provide recommendations for how to proceed with research and cooperation to tackle the vast number of PFASs on the market and in the environment.",

    "Abstract": "We submit that the safe operating space of the planetary boundary of novel entities is exceeded since annual production and releases are increasing at a pace that outstrips the global capacity for assessment and monitoring. The novel entities boundary in the planetary boundaries framework refers to entities that are novel in a geological sense and that could have large-scale impacts that threaten the integrity of Earth system processes. We review the scientific literature relevant to quantifying the boundary for novel entities and highlight plastic pollution as a particular aspect of high concern. An impact pathway from production of novel entities to impacts on Earth system processes is presented. We define and apply three criteria for assessment of the suitability of control variables for the boundary: feasibility, relevance, and comprehensiveness. We propose several complementary control variables to capture the complexity of this boundary, while acknowledging major data limitations. We conclude that humanity is currently operating outside the planetary boundary based on the weight-of-evidence for several of these control variables. The increasing rate of production and releases of larger volumes and higher numbers of novel entities with diverse risk potentials exceed societies’ ability to conduct safety related assessments and monitoring. We recommend taking urgent action to reduce the harm associated with exceeding the boundary by reducing the production and releases of novel entities, noting that even so, the persistence of many novel entities and/or their associated effects will continue to pose a threat.",

    "Abstract": "Due to chemical and physiological inertness and wide usage in nearly every aspect of our daily life, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are now ubiquitous in the environment, including drinking water sources. As most biological and chemical destruction methods have so far shown limited efficiencies, adsorption, a simple and cost-effective treatment, is widely adopted for the removal of PFAS from water/wastewater. This paper aims to review the recent progress in PFAS adsorption using various adsorbents. The performance of different types of adsorbents, including the traditional carbonaceous materials and resins as well as the newly-synthesized minerals, biomaterials, and polymers, in PFAS removal was summarized. Furthermore, the adsorption characteristics and mechanisms were critically reviewed. Real-life adsorption applications (large-scale setups, adsorption-involved treatment trains and point-of-use/point-of-entry systems) were also examined. Learned lessons, current challenges and recommendations on future research were provided regarding results of tests in real environmental matrices, pilot and/or field scale studies of promising newly-developed adsorbents, and the improvement of the removal of alternative PFAS (mostly short-chained ones).",

    "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are pollutants have attracted major concern due to their high persistence and bioaccumulation. They are causing increasingly serious epidemiological problems in many communities globally due to consuming PFAS-contaminated water sources. Necessarily, the behavior of PFAS in water and wastewater needs to be understood better. This study attempts to comprehensively review, analyze and discuss PFAS based on the following key aspects: (i) sources, (ii) occurrence in water and wastewater, (iii) transformation, fate and migration, and (iv) remediation technologies. Studies indicated that modern water and wastewater treatment plants cannot deal completely with PFAS and in some cases, the removal efficiency is minus -3500-fold. The main reasons are the high hydrophobicity of PFAS and presence of PFAS precursors. Precursors can account for 33–63% of total PFAS concentration in water and wastewater. Detection and identification of precursors are challenging due to the requirement of advanced analytical instrument and standard chemicals. Several technologies have been developed for PFAS remediation involving two main mechanisms: separation-concentration and destruction. The most widespread in-use technology is adsorption because it is reasonably affordable. Anion exchange resin and synthesized materials are the most effective sorbents having a sorption capacity of 100–2000 mg PFAS/g sorbent, effective within a few hours. The destruction technology such as plasma can also be a promising one for degrading PFAS to below health-based standard in 1 min. However, plasma is costly and not yet ready for full scale application.",

    "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of fluorinated organic compounds of anthropogenic origin. Due to their unique chemical properties, widespread production, environmental distribution, long-term persistence, bioaccumulative potential, and associated risks for human health, PFAS have been classified as persistent organic pollutants of significant concern. Scientific evidence from the last several decades suggests that their widespread occurrence in the environment correlates with adverse effects on human health and ecology. The presence of PFAS in the aquatic environment demonstrates a close link between the anthroposphere and the hydrological cycle, and concentrations of PFAS in surface and groundwater range in value along the ng L−1–μg L−1 scale. Here, we critically reviewed the research published in the last decade on the global occurrence and distribution of PFAS in the aquatic environment. Ours is the first paper to critically evaluate the occurrence of PFAS at the continental scale and the evolving global regulatory responses to manage and mitigate the adverse human health risks posed by PFAS. The review reports that PFAS are widespread despite being phased out—they have been detected in different continents irrespective of the level of industrial development. Their occurrence far from the potential sources suggests that long-range atmospheric transport is an important pathway of PFAS distribution. Recently, several studies have investigated the health impacts of PFAS exposure—they have been detected in biota, drinking water, food, air, and human serum. In response to the emerging information about PFAS toxicity, several countries have provided administrative guidelines for PFAS in water, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Germany, and Australia. In the US, additional regulatory measures are under consideration. Further, many PFAS have now been listed as persistent organic pollutants. This comprehensive review provides crucial baseline information on the global occurrence, distribution, and regulatory framework of PFAS.",

This critical review compiles the latest information on the worldwide distribution of PFAS and evaluates their fate in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). A large proportion (>30%) of monitoring studies in WWTPs were conducted in China, followed by Europe (30%) and North America (16%), whereas information is generally lacking for other parts of the world, including most of the developing countries. Short and long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) were widely detected in both the influents (up to 1,000 ng/L) and effluents (15 to >1,500 ng/L) of WWTPs. To date, limited data is available regarding levels of PFAS precursors and ultra-short chain PFAS in WWTPs. Most WWTPs exhibited low removal efficiencies for PFAS, and many studies reported an increase in the levels of PFAAs after wastewater treatment. The analysis of the fate of various classes of PFAS at different wastewater treatment stages (aerobic and/aerobic biodegradation, photodegradation, and chemical degradation) revealed biodegradation as the primary mechanism responsible for the transformation of PFAS precursors to PFAAs in WWTPs. Remediation studies at full scale and laboratory scale suggest advanced processes such as adsorption using ion exchange resins, electrochemical degradation, and nanofiltration are more effective in removing PFAS (~95–100%) than conventional processes. However, the applicability of such treatments for real-world WWTPs faces significant challenges due to the scaling-up requirements, mass-transfer limitations, and management of treatment by-products and wastes. Combining more than one technique for effective removal of PFAS, while addressing limitations of the individual treatments, could be beneficial. Considering environmental concentrations of PFAS, cost-effectiveness, and ease of operation, nanofiltration followed by adsorption using wood-derived biochar and/or activated carbons could be a viable option if introduced to conventional treatment systems. However, the large-scale applicability of the same needs to be further verified.",

    "Abstract": "The presence of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has caused serious problems for drinking water supplies especially at intake locations close to PFAS manufacturing facilities, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and sites where PFAS-containing firefighting foam was regularly used. Although monitoring is increasing, knowledge on PFAS occurrences particularly in municipal and industrial effluents is still relatively low. Even though the production of C8-based PFAS has been phased out, they are still being detected at many WWTPs. Emerging PFAS such as GenX and F-53B are also beginning to be reported in aquatic environments. This paper presents a broad review and discussion on the occurrence of PFAS in municipal and industrial wastewater which appear to be their main sources. Carbon adsorption and ion exchange are currently used treatment technologies for PFAS removal. However, these methods have been reported to be ineffective for the removal of short-chain PFAS. Several pioneering treatment technologies, such as electrooxidation, ultrasound, and plasma have been reported for PFAS degradation. Nevertheless, in-depth research should be performed for the applicability of emerging technologies for real-world applications. This paper examines different technologies and helps to understand the research needs to improve the development of treatment processes for PFAS in wastewater streams.",

    "Abstract": "Many existing technical feasibility and modelling studies in the energy field are criticised for their limited treatment of societal actors and socio-political dynamics, poor representation of the co-evolving nature of society and technology, and hence an inability to analyse socio-technical change. At the same time, prominent conceptual frameworks of socio-technical transitions that address these elements are often found to be difficult to operationalize in quantitative energy analyses that meet policy development requirements. However a new energy modelling paradigm has started to emerge for integrating both quantitative modelling and conceptual socio-technical transitions. This paper provides a taxonomy for this new model category: ‘socio-technical energy transition’ (STET) models. A review of existing STET models and their applications to the energy supply, buildings and transport sectors is provided. Following this review, the paper reflects on the extent to which these existing quantitative models captured the variety of factors covered in socio-technical transitions theory, highlights the challenges associated with their theoretical and behavioural validation, and proposes future development priorities for STET models.",

    "Abstract": "Anion exchange resins are being used by the drinking water industry to remove per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) including perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs) from water, and spent resins are commonly incinerated by the industry. By conducting thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) studies, this investigation is aimed at filling some of the knowledge gaps that currently exists in the incineration of PFAS-laden resins. This work is aimed at understanding the impact of characteristics (i.e., carbon chain length and acid functionality) of nine PFAS compounds, in the presence or absence of a calcium oxide (CaO) additive, on the decomposition and burning characteristics of PFAS-laden resins. The TGA profiles of selected pure PFAS compounds confirmed the near-complete evaporation of these compounds below their boiling points, whereas PFAS-laden resin profiles exhibited the partial holding of PFAS compounds by resin well above their boiling points. Resins laden with PFCAs exhibited TGA profiles similar to those of the blank resins, whereas resins laden with PFSAs showed a drastic weight loss from 400 to 500 °C. These results suggested that decomposition and oxidation reactions were accelerated by sulfonic acid functionalities, and the impact of sulfonic acid groups appears to increase with the increase in the chain length of PFSAs. The presence of the CaO additive resulted in similar TGA profiles for all tested PFCA-laden resins, where all exhibited a relatively flat profile in the∼470–700 °C range as a result of the simultaneous burning of carbon char and the reaction of CO2 with CaO, followed by a rapid weight loss at 700–800 °C from the decomposition of the formed CaCO3 to CaO. The TGA profiles of PFSA-laden resins in the presence of CaO exhibited a similar impact of sulfonic acid functionalities accelerating the decomposition and oxidation of the resin without any clear correlation with the PFSA chain length.",

    "Abstract": "The aims of this study were two-fold: (1) to improve our understanding of the thermal stability of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and (2) to investigate their decomposition mechanisms on spent granular activated carbon (GAC) during thermal reactivation. We studied seven perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), three perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs), and one perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acid (PFECA) in different atmospheres (N2, O2, CO2, and air). The destabilization of studied compounds during thermal treatment followed first-order kinetics. The temperature needed for thermally destabilizing PFCAs increased with the number of perfluorinated carbons (nCF2). Decomposition of PFCAs such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) on GAC initiated at temperatures as low as 200 °C. The PFECA was even more readily decomposed than PFCA with the same nCF2. PFSAs such as perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), on the other hand, required a much higher temperature (≥450 °C) to decompose. Volatile organofluorine species were the main thermal decomposition product of PFOA and PFOS at low to moderate temperatures (≤600 °C). Efficient mineralization to fluoride ions (>80%) of PFOA and PFOS on GAC occurred at 700 °C or higher, accompanied by near complete PFOA and PFOS decomposition (>99.9%). Thermal decomposition pathways of PFOA were proposed.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we have developed an innovative thermal degradation strategy for treating per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS)-containing solid materials. Our strategy satisfies three criteria: the ability to achieve near-complete degradation of PFASs within a short timescale, nonselectivity, and low energy cost. In our method, a metallic reactor containing a PFAS-laden sample was subjected to electromagnetic induction that prompted a rapid temperature rise of the reactor via the Joule heating effect. We demonstrated that subjecting PFASs (0.001–12 μmol) to induction heating for a brief duration (e.g., <40 s) resulted in substantial degradation (>90%) of these compounds, including recalcitrant short-chain PFASs and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids. This finding prompted us to conduct a detailed study of the thermal phase transitions of PFASs using thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). We identified at least two endothermic DSC peaks for anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic PFASs, signifying the melting and evaporation of the melted PFASs. Melting and evaporation points of many PFASs were reported for the first time. Our data suggest that the rate-limiting step in PFAS thermal degradation is linked with phase transitions (e.g., evaporation) occurring on different time scales. When PFASs are rapidly heated to temperatures similar to those produced during induction heating, the evaporation of melted PFAS slows down, allowing for the degradation of the melted PFAS.",

    "Abstract": "Conversion of sewage sludge (SS) into biochar through pyrolysis is an alternative to make this residue useful for agricultural purposes. Despite advances in interpreting the functions of SS biochar (SSB) for improving soil quality, it is still necessary to understand its residual effect on the dynamics of heavy metals (HM), especially under field conditions in tropical soils. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the residual effect of the application of SSB obtained at different pyrolysis temperatures on the accumulation, availability and bioaccumulation of HMs by corn cultivated in a tropical soil. For this purpose, a field experiment was conducted for three years to assess the total and available levels of HMs in the soil and the leaf concentration after suspending the application of 30 t ha−1 of SSB produced at 300 °C (BC300) and 500 °C (BC500). In general, the HM contents were below the maximum allowed by environmental legislation in several countries. SSB, regardless of temperature, was effective in immobilizing non-essential HMs for plants, such as Cd, Co, Cr and Pb, in the soil. On the other hand, SSB was able to supply micronutrients to corn plants after amendment ceased. Thus, the lack of negative long-term effects confirms the feasibility and safety of using SSB in agricultural areas with regards to contamination by HM, and makes it an alternative for the disposal of domestic SS.",

    "Abstract": "Applying biochar products from sewage sludge (SS) pyrolysis as soil amendment for plant cultivation was investigated in this study with special attention paid to heavy metal accumulation in the plants when pyrolysis temperature and biochar-to-soil mass ratio (C:S) were changed. Biochar obtained at four different temperatures were adopted as soil amendment for Allium sativum L. garlic plant cultivation. Experimental results revealed that biochars were rich in nutrient contents and they improved garlic yields. Although contents of heavy metals including As, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cd, Cr and Cu, etc. were elevated in the biochars compared to local soil, they fell within the acceptable limits for land application and SS is a suitable biochar resource, especially biochar produced at 450°C had rich micropores, relatively stable functional groups in structure and rugged surface to contact well with soil, conducive to its usage as a biochar. The garlic grew faster when planted in the biochar-amended soil and had higher final dry matter yields than those planted in the reference soil, especially biochar produced at 450°C corresponding to the highest final yields. The C:S ratio related to the highest garlic yields changed when the pyrolysis temperature was changed and this ratio was 1:4 for the biochar produced at 450°C. General heavy metal accumulation in the garlic occurred only for the most enriched Zn and Cu, and mainly in the roots & bulbs; in addition this bioaccumulation was increasing as leaching from biochar increased but not increasing with C:S ratio. The garlic planted in soil amended with biochar of 450°C contained the lowest level of heavy metals compared to other biochars. Those results indicated that heavy metal accumulation in plants can be inhibited through proper pyrolysis temperature choice and prevention of heavy metal leaching from the SS biochar.",

    "Abstract": "The production of biochar is a technological alternative to transform sewage sludge (SS) into a useful product for agro-environmental purposes. Despite an increased knowledge on the role of sewage sludge biochar (SSB) for improving soil quality and crop productivity, some concerns remain regarding the accumulation of total and available heavy metals (HM) in soils amended with SSB. Particularly, there is a dearth of studies under field conditions and in tropical latitudes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of applying SS biochars, prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures, on the accumulation and availability of heavy metals (HM). To do so, 15Mgha−1 of SS biochar produced at 300°C (BC300) and 500°C (BC500) were applied to a soil cultivated with corn. Total and available levels of HM in SS, biochars and post-harvest soil were determined. Pyrolysis concentrated total HM in the biochars in relation to the SS. However, HM availability was reduced with increasing pyrolysis temperature due to an increase in pH, pore volume, specific surface area, P and K content, and reduction of the H/C ratio. Biochar did not alter the total HM contents, with the exception of Mn. Available levels of all HM in the soil were <1.2% of the total contents. In addition, the available levels of Zn and Mn, when evaluated as micronutrients, were considered low. Therefore, the results of the present study indicate that biochar produced from SS of a sewage treatment plant processing predominantly domestic sewage can be used in agriculture, without risk of soil contamination by HM. Moreover, in some tropical soils, with a low value of micronutrients, biochar can provide a source of these elements.",

The aim of this work is to investigate the influence of pyrolysis temperature on production of wastewater sludge biochar and evaluate the properties required for agronomic applications. Wastewater sludge collected from an urban wastewater treatment plant was pyrolysed in a laboratory scale reactor. It was found that by increasing the pyrolysis temperature (over the range from 300 °C to 700 °C) the yield of biochar decreased. Biochar produced at low temperature was acidic whereas at high temperature it was alkaline in nature. The concentration of nitrogen was found to decrease while micronutrients increased with increasing temperature. Concentrations of trace metals present in wastewater sludge varied with temperature and were found to primarily enriched in the biochar.",

Results showed that the sludge from Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) with pure domestic wastewater influent and less mixed industrial wastewater produced the highest biochar yield, and these SDBC samples have the highest isoelectric point (IEP) and the most uniform charge distribution, compared with other sources. For different pyrolysis temperatures, 400°C tend to achieve more uniform surface charge distribution of SDBC, due to the oxidation process more occurred on the external surface than internal matrix at this temperature. In addition, a pyrolysis temperature of 300°C resulted in the most reduction in DTPA-extractable metals of SDBCs, owing to the organo-metallic complex formed with the abundant presence of functional groups and available phosphorus content, which were easily decomposed or degraded at higher temperatures.",

    "Abstract": "Biochar addition to soil has been proposed to improve plant growth by increasing soil fertility, minimizing bioaccumulation of toxic metal(liod)s and mitigating climate change. Sewage sludge (SS) is an attractive, though potentially problematic, feedstock of biochar. It is attractive because of its large abundance; however, it contains elevated concentrations of metal(loid)s and other contaminants. The pyrolysis of SS to biochar (SSBC) may be a way to reduce the availability of these contaminants to the soil and plants. Using rice plant pot experiments, we investigated the influence of SSBC upon biomass yield, bioaccumulation of nutrients, and metal(loid)s, and green housegas (GHG) emissions. SSBC amendments increased soil pH, total nitrogen, soil organic carbon and available nutrients and decreased bioavailable As, Cr, Co, Ni, and Pb (but not Cd, Cu, and Zn). Regarding rice plant properties, SSBC amendments significantly (P ≤ 0.01) increased shoot biomass (71.3–92.2%), grain yield (148.8–175.1%), and the bioaccumulation of phosphorus and sodium, though decreased the bioaccumulation of nitrogen (except in grain) and potassium. Amendments of SSBC significantly (P ≤ 0.05) reduced the bioaccumulation of As, Cr, Co, Cu, Ni, and Pb, but increased that of Cd and Zn, though not above limits set by Chinese regulations. Finally regarding GHG emissions, SSBC significantly (P < 0.01) reduced N2O emissions and stimulated the uptake/oxidation of CH4 enough to make both the cultivated and uncultivated paddy soil a CH4 sink. SSBC can be beneficial in rice paddy soil but the actual associated benefits will depend on site-specific conditions and source of SS; long-term effects remain a further unknown.",

    "Abstract": "In order to tackle climate change, a transition to a renewable based energy system is crucial. A renewable based hydrogen economy is one of the possible implementations of such a system. The world receives ample energy from the sun that can be harvested by PV solar cells and, indirectly, by wind turbines. In order to use the most optimal locations for collecting and concentrating energy from these diffuse sources, a long distance transmission network is needed. Mature and semi-mature technologies are available for all parts of the system: from collection to transmission to end-use. In an early stage of development, when new technologies have to win market share from the existing energy system, their development is driven almost exclusively by the reduction of costs per J delivered. However, if a technology should be able to deliver tens to hundreds of EJ, resource constraints can become show stoppers. Many of the newest, most cost-efficient, energy technologies make use of scarce resources and, although they may play an important role in the transition process, they can not be scaled up the level we need for a complete transition. In most cases however other technologies are available that use more abundant materials, be it often at a cost of efficiency. The issue is not only with scarce resources. The sheer size of the energy transition will also challenge the industrial capacity for the mining and production of bulk materials like steel and copper.",

    "Abstract": "Towards decarbonizing the global economy, hydrogen produced through water electrolysis is expected to be one of the key solutions for variable renewable energy storage and sector coupling, in particular, via the transport sector in the next few decades. Even though water is an important aspect of the environmental impact, the impact assessment of hydrogen production on water is lacking. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for assessing the water footprints of hydrogen production from electrolysis. A major innovative aspect is to demonstrate the geographical distribution of the footprints along the supply chain. The water footprints for hydrogen produced from grid electricity, wind and solar power in Australia was analysed as a case study. Sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the influence of key parameters including Solar Radiation Level, Silicon Efficiency, and Lifetime of PV Modules. The study finds that the water consumption footprint is much less than that reported in the literature and large part of the water could be consumed indirectly outside of hydrogen producing countries. The quantity of water footprint varies significantly among different assumptions. The findings provide insights into both domestic and cross-boundary water impacts of hydrogen electrolysis and can thus inform policy debates in each nation and beyond.",

    "Abstract": "This research examines the life-cycle water and nutrients usage of microalgae-based biodiesel production. The influence of water types, operation with and without recycling, algal species, geographic distributions are analyzed. The results confirm the competitiveness of microalgae-based biofuels and highlight the necessity of recycling harvested water and using sea/wastewater as water source. To generate 1kg biodiesel, 3726kg water, 0.33kg nitrogen, and 0.71kg phosphate are required if freshwater used without recycling. Recycling harvest water reduces the water and nutrients usage by 84% and 55%. Using sea/wastewater decreases 90% water requirement and eliminates the need of all the nutrients except phosphate. The variation in microalgae species and geographic distribution are analyzed to reflect microalgae biofuel development in the US. The impacts of current federal and state renewable energy programs are also discussed to suggest suitable microalgae biofuel implementation pathways and identify potential bottlenecks.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract: The present study has analyzed the techno-economic feasibility of applying gasification technology to the energy use of Municipal Solid Waste in an industrial plant. In that case, the obtained gas shall be used as an alternative source for electric energy generation. The technical feasibility analysis took into account the waste suitability to the gasification process, as well as the gasification process efficiency, through tests carried out in a testing plant, and an estimation of electric power was obtained. The economic viability studied the indicators Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return and Discounted Payback considering the cash flow estimation from plant installation and operation. A univariate sensitivity analysis of Net Present Value has considered the variables with influence on the cash flow, such as the Minimum Attractiveness Return Rate, energy tariff, installed power, operating and maintenance costs and the undertaking unitary cost. The results suggested the technical feasibility considering both the suitability of the waste for the process and its efficiency, which reached values of 62% allowing to reach an estimated electric power of 1.46 MW. The economic viability was verified under the studied conditions. The sensitivity analysis showed that the economic viability was sensitive to the variation of some parameters estimated on cash flow, which in turn leads to an understanding of the need for subsidies as an incentive to the technology effective viability. This study provides decisions makers with data and information on how to adopt the gasification technology in Brazil.",

    "Abstract": "The access to electricity has increased worldwide, growing from 60 million additional consumers per year in 2000–2012 to 100 million per year in 2012–2016. Despite this growth, approximately 675 million people will still lack access to electricity in 2030, indicating that electricity demand will continue to increase. Unfortunately, traditional large fossil power technologies based on coal, oil and natural gas lead to a major concern in tackling worldwide carbon dioxide emissions, and nuclear power remains unpopular due to public safety concerns. Distributed power generation utilizing CO2-neutral sources, such as gasification of biomass and municipal solid wastes (MSW), can play an important role in meeting the world energy demand in a sustainable way. This review focuses on the recent technology developments on seven power generation technologies (i.e. internal combustion engine, gas turbine, micro gas turbine, steam turbine, Stirling engine, organic rankine cycle generator, and fuel cell) suitable for distributed power applications with capability of independent operation using syngas derived from gasification of biomass and MSW. Technology selection guidelines is discussed based on criteria, including hardware modification required, size inflexibility, sensitivity to syngas contaminants, operational uncertainty, efficiency, lifetime, fast ramp up/down capability, controls and capital cost. Major challenges facing further development and commercialization of these power generation technologies are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "PFAS from degrading landfill waste partition into organic matter, leachate, and landfill gas. Driven by the limited understanding of PFAS distribution in landfill organics, we analyzed PFAS across various depths and seven spatially distinct locations within a municipal landfill. The measured PFAS concentrations in organics ranged from 6.71 to 73.06 µg kg−1, a sum of twenty-nine PFAS from six classes. Perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and fluorotelomer carboxylic acids (FTCAs) were the dominant classes, constituting 25–82 % and 8–40 % of total PFAS at different depths. PFBA was the most dominant PFCA with a concentration range of 0.90–37.91 µg kg−1, while 5:3 FTCA was the most prevalent FTCA with a concentration of 0.26–17.99 µg kg−1. A clear vertical distribution of PFAS was observed, with significantly greater PFAS concentrations at the middle depths (20–35 ft), compared to the shallow (10–20 ft) and high depths (35–50 ft). A strong positive correlation (r > 0.50) was noted between total PFAS, total carbon, and dissolved organic matter in landfill organics. Multivariate statistical analysis inferred common sources and transformations of PFAS within the landfill. This study underscores the importance of a system-level analysis of PFAS fate in landfills, considering waste variability, chemical properties, release mechanisms, and PFAS transformations.",

    "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contaminated compost materials have been applied over the last few decades to agricultural fields in Germany, resulting in large-scale diffuse PFAS plumes. The leaching behavior of PFAS from the first two identified contaminated agricultural sites in Germany were investigated, one at Brilon-Scharfenberg, North Rhine-Westphalia (BS-NRW), and the other at Rastatt/Mannheim, Baden-Württemberg. The specific objectives of this study were to assess the longevity of the PFAS agricultural sources and compare standardized column percolation tests to long-term leaching of PFAS from contaminated sites. The advection-dispersion model (ADM) was used to compare the leaching behavior of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) from standardized column percolation tests and long-term field leaching data from the BS-NRW site. Column leaching tests conducted with PFOS and PFOA contaminated soil simulated the initial rapid decline but did not predict the long-term behavior (tailing) observed at the field site over 12 years. Trend analyses of the PFAS field data from the BS-NRW showed that concentrations had stabilized and that individual PFAS exhibited distinct seasonal fluctuations; the latter is likely due to the ongoing transformation of precursors and a seasonal influence on production rates of mobile PFAS. Mass balances conducted at both sites indicate that complete removal of these compounds will likely take years to decades to occur, which is expected from the results of the column leaching tests.",

    "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been used in a variety of consumer and industrial products and are known to accumulate in sewage sludge due to sorption and their recalcitrant nature. Treatment processes ensure safe and high-quality biosolids by reducing the potential for adverse environmental impacts such as pathogen levels; however, they have yet to be evaluated for their impact on the fate of PFAS. The objective of this study was to compare PFAS concentrations in four commercially available biosolid-based products that received different types of treatments: heat treatment, composting, blending, and thermal hydrolysis. Seventeen perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) were quantified using liquid chromatography with tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry followed by screening for 30 PFAA precursors. Treatment processes did not reduce PFAA loads except for blending, which served only to dilute concentrations. Several PFAA precursors were identified with 6:2 and 8:2 fluorotelomer phosphate diesters in all samples pre- and post-treatment. Practitioner points Heat treatment and composting increased perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) concentrations. Only dilution from blending with non-PFAS material decreased PFAA concentrations. Thermal hydrolysis process had no apparent effect on PFAA concentrations. PFAS sources are a greater driver of PFAS loads in biosolid-based products than treatment processes.",

    "Abstract": "Biosolids (stabilised sewage sludge) are the final solid residues of the wastewater treatment process and are generally applied on agricultural land in many countries, including Australia. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of synthetic fluorinated chemicals with ubiquitous applications in consumer products and persist in the environment. Globally, PFAS have been detected in biosolids and are considered a source of PFAS discharge to the environment. The thermal treatment of biosolids is gaining increasing interest in the water sector. Therefore, the viability of thermal techniques for the safe destruction of PFAS has received substantial research attention in the last few years. Recent studies suggest that PFAS in biosolids can be removed and potentially destroyed during combustive (such as incineration) and non-combustive thermal treatment, such as pyrolysis, gasification, and hydrothermal carbonisation/liquefaction. However, there is limited understanding on the fate and transformation of PFAS degradation products across the overall thermal treatment process from biosolids feed pre-treatment to the gas cleaning (post-thermal treatment) stage. This review consolidates the current knowledge on PFAS transformation, destruction, and final fate before, during, and after thermal treatment of biosolids, covering lab, pilot scale, and industrial studies. It is suggested that PFAS degradation mechanisms during thermal treatment of biosolids may differ from the established pathways for pure PFAS salts, given that biosolids have a complex organic and inorganic matrix and typically have low PFAS concentrations. Among all thermal treatment techniques, pyrolysis has received extensive investigations at different scales of operation. However, for all techniques, treatment temperatures and residence time need to be sufficiently optimised for designing realistic large-scale thermal systems relevant to biosolids’ compositional peculiarities for PFAS destruction.",

    "Abstract": "PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) possess hydrophobic and hydrophilic characteristics, recalcitrant nature due to a strong C-F bond, and have the potential to endure adverse environmental situations and greater surface activity. Biosolids are the side-resultant in the sludge treatment process, which are primarily applied as soil conditioners. These PFAS have been detected at an abnormal level in biosolids and through various routes retained in the human and animal systems. However, for PFAS, in-depth consideration of physical and chemical properties and exposure pathways is still limited, ultimately curbing the development of new technologies which pave the trails for PFAS destruction. Several attempts have been carried out using the biological approach, and hydrolytic methods, but the carbon–fluorine bond being resistant to these approaches limits them. Therefore, impactful end-of-life technologies are required for PFAS remediation in biosolids. The current review provides new insights into PFAS destruction technologies. Different emerging PFAS destruction technologies such as incineration, hydrothermal liquefaction, pyrolysis, thermal hydrolysis, supercritical water oxidation, and several other processes, their latest advancements and limitations have been discussed in detail in this current study. Classification of PFAS, exposure of PFAS to the environment and human exposure, ways in which humans can avoid PFAS, and different detection techniques for PFAS analysis along with their merits and demerits have been broadly discussed in this review. The mechanism of PFAS degradation during thermal processes has also been covered.",

    "Abstract": "Horizontal ball mills (HBMs) have been proven capable of remediating per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in soil. Industrial-sized HBMs, which could easily be transported to impacted locations for on-site, ex-situ remediation, are readily available. This study examined PFAS degradation using an industrial-scale, 267 L cylinder HBM. This is the typical scale used in the industry before field application. Near-complete destruction of 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS), as well as the non-target PFAS in a modern fluorotelomer-based aqueous film forming foam (AFFF), was achieved when spiked onto nepheline syenite sand (NSS) and using potassium hydroxide (KOH) as a co-milling reagent. Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) showed much better and more consistent results with scale-up regardless of KOH. Perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) was examined for the first time using a HBM and behaved similarly to PFOS. Highly challenging field soils from a former firefighting training area (FFTA) were purposefully used to test the limits of the HBM. To quantify the effectiveness, free fluoride analysis was used; changes between unmilled and milled soil were measured up to 7.8 mg/kg, which is the equivalent of 12 mg/kg PFOS. Notably, this does not factor in insoluble fluoride complexes that may form in milled soils, so the actual amount of PFAS destroyed may be higher. Soil health, evaluated through the assessment of key microbial and associated plant health parameters, was not significantly affected as a result of milling, although it was characterized as poor to begin with. Leachability reached 100 % in milled soil with KOH, but already ranged from 81 to 96 % in unmilled soil. A limited assessment of the hazards associated with the inhalation of PFAS-impacted dust from ball-milling, as well as the cross-contamination potential to the environment, showed that the risk was low in both cases; however, precautions should always be taken.",

    "Abstract": "Perfluorinated and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large class of synthetic organic chemicals whose structures contain fully or partially fluorinated carbon chains with different chain lengths and functional groups, and have been widely used since they were first synthesized in the 1940 s. Their unique fluorine-carbon bonds provide exceptional thermal and chemical stability, rendering them highly persistent in the environment, often referred to as 'forever chemicals' in contemporary scientific literature. PFAS have been found to have adverse effects on human health and environmental quality. PFAS degradation hinges on the disruption of carbon-carbon and carbon-fluorine bonds. This review delineates the degradation technologies of PFAS, including chemical oxidation, chemical reduction, ultrasonication, photolysis, electrochemistry, thermal degradation, mechanochemistry and microbial degradation. It offers a comparative analysis of these eight technologies based on degradation efficiency, defluorination efficiency, and degradation rate. Among these technologies, mechanochemical transformation is emerging as a promising approach in detoxifying PFAS. Mechanochemical treatment can be achieved at ambient temperature and pressure by the high-energy milling of the polluted materials. Future work should focus on the scaleup and economics of the advanced treatment technologies to treat and remediate PFAS and other highly recalcitrant pollutants.",

    "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are manmade, fluorinated organic chemicals which have been identified as persistent organic pollutants. PFAS have surface active properties that have made them suitable for applications in oil- and water-resistant products, as well as many firefighting foams. No on-site remediation strategies exist to treat PFAS impacted soils. Mechanochemical remediation of PFOS- and PFOA-amended sand via a planetary ball mill was studied. The effect of sand mass, KOH as a co-milling reagent, and water saturation on the degradation of PFOA and PFOS was evaluated. By 4 h of milling concentrations were reduced by up to 98% for PFOS-amended dry sand and 99% for PFOA-amended dry sand without the addition of a co-milling reagent. Water saturation was determined to be a significant hindrance on the mechanochemical destruction of PFOS and PFOA. A maximum of 89% of fluoride was recovered from PFOS-amended sand when KOH was used as a co-milling reagent. It is hypothesized that reactive particles generated from the fracture of sand grains react with PFAS molecules to initiate destruction, which can result in full defluorination. Milling experiments were also conducted on soils from a Canadian firefighting training area (FFTA), demonstrating that PFOS concentrations can be reduced by up to 96% in site soils. For the first time, ball milling for the remediation of PFAS in environmental media has been demonstrated using amended sand and legacy soils from a FFTA.",

In particular, this study aims to (a) investigate the performance of a semi-pilot fluidised bed pyrolysis unit in converting biosolids into biochar, (b) examine the ability of the pyrolysis–combustion integrated process to destruct PFASs present in biosolids and (c) study the application of biosolids derived biochar for removing PFASs from contaminated water. The semi-pilot fluidised bed pyrolysis unit demonstrated stable temperature and oxygen profiles in the reactor. The yield of biochar was found to be 36–45% at studied temperatures (500–600 °C). The produced biosolids derived biochar samples, due to their lower H/C and O/C ratio, were found to be extremely stable with an expected long (millennia) residence time in soil. It was concluded that >90% removal of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) from biosolids derived biochar could be achieved in the pyrolysis–combustion integrated process. The biosolids derived biochar demonstrated >80% adsorption of long-chain PFASs and 19–27% adsorption of short-chain PFASs from PFAS contaminated water.",

    "Abstract": "This study explores the recovery of resources and energy from sewage sludge through the production of sludge-based activated carbon (SBAC) considering circular economy principles. The SBAC production costs were estimated under three scenarios considering various sludge dewatering/drying schemes to determine the production feasibility and its role in the circular economy. SBAC was tested in the removal of a mixture of nine commonly detected poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in environmentally relevant concentrations of ∽50 μg/L in comparison to commercially available activated carbon (AC) using 5 mg of sorbent and 5 mL of a nine-PFAS mixture in deionised water. SBAC can be produced at approximately 1.2 US $/kg, which is substantially lower than the average production cost of commercial AC of >3 US $/kg. A net revenue ranging from 2 to 7 US $/kg SBAC was estimated by recycling the produced non-condensable gases and bio-oil to produce energy and selling the SBAC. Batch adsorption tests showed that the PFASs removal of SBAC was superior to that of granular AC and similar to that of powdered AC, reaching >91% to below the detection limit. The kinetics tests revealed that adsorption by SBAC and AC occurred within 15 min. The overall results demonstrate the potential of SBAC as an effective sorbent for PFASs, achieving waste-to-resources circular economy via resource and energy recovery from sewage sludge, eliminating sludge disposal and contaminant-leaching to the environment, and in enhancing the quality of wastewater effluent before discharge.",

    "Abstract": "Concentrations of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) present in wastewater treatment biosolids are a growing concern. Pyrolysis is a thermal treatment technology for biosolids that can produce a useful biochar product with reduced levels of PFAS and other contaminants. In August 2020, a limited-scope study investigated target PFAS removal of a commercial pyrolysis system processing biosolid with the analysis of 41 target PFAS compounds in biosolids and biochar performed by two independent laboratories. The concentrations of 21 detected target compounds in the input biosolids ranged between approximately 2 µg/kg and 85 µg/kg. No PFAS compounds were detected in the biochar. The PFAS concentrations in the biochar were assumed to equal the compounds’ minimum detection limits (MDLs). The pyrolysis system’s target PFAS removal efficiencies (REs) were estimated to range between >81.3% and >99.9% (mean >97.4%) with the lowest REs being associated with the lowest detected PFAS concentrations and the highest MDLs. No information on non-target PFAS compounds in influent or effluent media or products of incomplete combustion was considered. Selected gaseous emissions were measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry to provide additional information on air emissions after process controls. This limited-scope study indicated that additional research to further understand this process is warranted.Implications: Development of alternative approaches to manage PFAS-impacted biosolids is of emerging international importance. A commercially operating biosolid pyrolysis process was shown to lower target PFAS levels in produced biochar. Additional research is warranted to understand all potential PFAS transformation emission routes and optimal air pollution emissions control strategies for this technology class.",

    "Abstract": "The release of persistent per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) into the environment is a major concern for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). To complement its ongoing research efforts addressing PFAS contamination, the U.S. EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) commissioned the PFAS Innovative Treatment Team (PITT) to provide new perspectives on treatment and disposal of high priority PFAS-containing wastes. During its six-month tenure, the team was charged with identifying and developing promising solutions to destroy PFAS. The PITT examined emerging technologies for PFAS waste treatment and selected four technologies for further investigation. These technologies included mechanochemical treatment, electrochemical oxidation, gasification and pyrolysis, and supercritical water oxidation. This paper highlights these four technologies and discusses their prospects and the development needed before potentially becoming available solutions to address PFAS-contaminated waste.Implications: This paper examines four novel, non-combustion technologies or applications for the treatment of persistent per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) wastes. These technologies are introduced to the reader along with their current state of development and areas for further development. This information will be useful for developers, policy makers, and facility managers that are facing increasing issues with disposal of PFAS wastes.",

    "Abstract": "Biosolids are byproducts of wastewater treatment. With the increasing global population, the amounts of wastewater to be treated are expanding, along with the amounts of biosolids generated. The reuse of biosolids is now accepted for diversified applications in fields such as agriculture, engineering, agro-forestry. However, biosolids are known to be potential carriers of compounds that can be toxic to living beings or alter the environment. Therefore, biosolid reuse is subject to regulations, mandatory analyses are performed on heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants or pathogens. Conventional methods for the analysis of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants are demanding, lengthy, and sometimes unsafe. Here, we propose mass spectrometry imaging as a faster and safer method using small amounts of material to monitor heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants in different types of biosolids, allowing for ecological and health risk assessment before reuse. Our methodology can be extended to other soil-like matrices., Mass spectrometry imaging is a suitable tool for the analysis of non-cohesive materials. Here, authors show that it can be used to detect persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and heavy metals (HMs) in biosolids using small amounts of material with speed and safety.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract\n            \n              Effective treatment of waste streams such as municipal waste-activated sludge (WAS) presents an opportunity for energy and nutrient recovery, water reclamation, and mitigation of climate change. WAS is a waste product of the activated sludge treatment (AST) process widely used for municipal wastewater. Currently, WAS treatment and disposal account for up to 50% of the total operation cost and 40% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from wastewater treatment plants. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is usually preferred for WAS treatment since it is more economical compared to other existing technologies. The decomposition of sludge during AD releases nutrients, which are then discharged in the anaerobic effluent, polluting recipient water bodies and increasing the nutrient burden. The nutrients, mainly nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), can be crystallised into struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate, NH\n              4\n              MgPO\n              4\n              .6H\n              2\n              O) with numerous agricultural applications as fertilisers. The present review focusses on struvite recovery from anaerobically digested WAS and its potential application for crop production.\n            \n            \n              Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Under the EU chemicals regulation REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals EC 1907/2006), registrants are not obliged to provide information related to intrinsic substance properties for substances that pose a threat to the drinking water resources. In 2019, perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy)-propanoic acid (HFPO-DA trade name GenX) were demonstrated to have an equivalent level of concern (ELoC) to persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic or very persistent and very bioaccumulative (PBT/vPvB) substances owing to their persistent, mobile and toxic (PMT) substance properties and very persistent and very mobile (vPvM) substance properties, respectively. They were both subsequently identified as substances of very high concern (SVHC) applying Article 57(f) in REACH. This work follows up on this regulatory decision by presenting a science based, conceptual level comparison that all PMT/vPvM substances pose an ELoC to PBT/vPvB substances. Using the two cases named above, as well as 1,4-dioxane, 16 categories were developed to evaluate a) serious effects on human health, b) serious effects on the environment and c) additional effects. 1,4-dioxane has recently been proposed to be classified as Carcinogenic 1B by the Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC). The aim was to enable an objective and scientifically justified conclusion that these classes of substances have an equivalent level of concern for the environment and human health.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              In all of the categories related to human health, the environment and other effects, the PMT/vPvM case study substances exhibited comparable effects to PBT/vPvB substances. A difference in the human and environmental exposure pathways of PMT/vPvM and PBT/vPvB substances exists as they vary temporally and spatially. However, effects and impacts are similar, with PMT/vPvM substances potentially accumulating in (semi-)closed drinking water cycles and pristine aquatic environments, and PBT/vPvB substances accumulating in humans and the food chain. Both PMT/vPvM and PBT/vPvB substances share the common difficulty that long term and long-range transport and risk of exposure is very difficult to determine in advance and with sufficient accuracy.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              The registration process of substances under REACH should reflect that PMT/vPvM substances pose an equivalent level of concern to PBT/vPvB substances.",

    "Abstract": "The presence of emerging pollutants (EPs) in water poses a potentially new and serious challenge on human health. Here, we reviewed the relevant literatures published in 2017, summarized the occurrence, environmental fate, transport and impacts of EPs in the environment, and analyzed the environmental toxicity of personal care products (PPCPs), endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), nanoparticles (NPs) and nanomaterials (NMs). This — review mainly focused on the occurrence surveys on surface water and the associations between exposure to EPs and toxicity of testing organisms. The control strategies and regulation for EPs based on the screening and monitoring methods were also discussed. Future efforts should be made to establish a comprehensive framework to study the adverse effects of EPs on organisms and new policies and legislations should be developed to control the release of hazardous EPs to the environment.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract\n            The protection and management of water resources continues to be challenged by multiple and ongoing factors such as shifts in demographic, social, economic, and public health requirements. Physical limitations placed on access to potable supplies include natural and human‐caused factors such as aquifer depletion, aging infrastructure, saltwater intrusion, floods, and drought. These factors, although varying in magnitude, spatial extent, and timing, can exacerbate the potential for contaminants of concern (CECs) to be present in sources of drinking water, infrastructure, premise plumbing and associated tap water. This monograph examines how current and emerging scientific efforts and technologies increase our understanding of the range of CECs and drinking water issues facing current and future populations. It is not intended to be read in one sitting, but is instead a starting point for scientists wanting to learn more about the issues surrounding CECs. This text discusses the topical evolution CECs over time (Section 1), improvements in measuring chemical and microbial CECs, through both analysis of concentration and toxicity (Section 2) and modeling CEC exposure and fate (Section 3), forms of treatment effective at removing chemical and microbial CECs (Section 4), and potential for human health impacts from exposure to CECs (Section 5). The paper concludes with how changes to water quantity, both scarcity and surpluses, could affect water quality (Section 6). Taken together, these sections document the past 25 years of CEC research and the regulatory response to these contaminants, the current work to identify and monitor CECs and mitigate exposure, and the challenges facing the future.\n          , \n            Plain Language Summary\n            Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are included in an ever‐evolving list of chemicals and microorganisms that are not currently regulated in drinking, recreational, or environmental waters but may be detrimental to human or ecological health. Advances in analytical technology have allowed the detection of these contaminants at ever decreasing concentrations. Additional techniques, such as nontargeted analyses and bioanalytical tools, have expanded our understanding on the occurrence of CECs both individually and in mixtures. Even with new analytical tools, little is known about the potentially tens of thousands of CECs that may be present in water. Models could be used to predict the fate and occurrence of these contaminants. Information on the toxicity to human and aquatic life, both for individual contaminants and mixtures, can follow environmental detection. Advancements in wastewater and drinking water treatment have increased the capacity for the reduction of contaminants in water. More research would be useful to determine human exposures that are occurring through all exposure routes to determine if, and where, additional treatment would be beneficial. If water resources become more limited due to population increases, climatic change, poor treatment performance, or other factors, CECs may become a larger concern for human and ecological health.\n          , \n            Key Points\n            \n              \n                \n                  Contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) are an ever‐evolving list of chemicals and microorganisms that are not currently regulated in water\n                \n                \n                  Advances in analytical technology have allowed the detection of individual and mixtures of CECs at ever decreasing concentrations\n                \n                \n                  Transdisciplinary research can be used to address science gaps in water monitoring, treatment optimization, and source water protection",

    "Abstract": "This critical review analyzes methodologies used to collect, quantify, and characterize microplastics in both wastewater and drinking water. Researchers used different techniques at all stages, from collection to characterization, for quantifying microplastics in urban water systems. This represents a barrier to comprehensively assess the current loads of microplastic and to compare the results obtained by such assessments. The compiled studies address microplastic contamination using four types of sample collection techniques, four methods for processing samples, and four techniques for characterizing microplastics. This results in significant discrepancies in each of the following: (1) reported concentrations in both wastewater effluents and drinking water, (2) microplastic characteristics (i.e., size, color, shape, and composition), and (3) quality control and assurance procedures. Finally, this review qualitatively evaluated the reports by the completeness of their data based on a ranking system using five criteria: sample collection, sample processing, quality control, identification technique, and results. The results of this ranking system clarify disparities between the studies.",

    "Abstract": "Biochar can be used in a large number of applications, ranging from heat and power production to soil amendment. The properties of carbonized biomass depend on the feedstock and the process conditions. Selection of suitable conditions to produce a char with the desired properties therefore requires knowledge of dependencies and influencing factors, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This paper reviews and summarizes the results from a large number of experiments on biochar production in order to give a general overview of the properties that can be achieved by feedstock selection and process design. Production processes include both torrefaction as well as slow pyrolysis at high temperatures. The data evaluation has shown that among all process conditions, the treatment temperature has by far the most dominant influence on all properties. Especially the rather narrow temperature range between 200 and 400 °C causes the most significant changes and is therefore very sensible to influences and possibly difficult to control.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract\n            \n              Reports of environmental and human health impacts of per‐ and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have greatly increased in the peer‐reviewed literature. The goals of the present review are to assess the state of the science regarding toxicological effects of PFAS and to develop strategies for advancing knowledge on the health effects of this large family of chemicals. Currently, much of the toxicity data available for PFAS are for a handful of chemicals, primarily legacy PFAS such as perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate. Epidemiological studies have revealed associations between exposure to specific PFAS and a variety of health effects, including altered immune and thyroid function, liver disease, lipid and insulin dysregulation, kidney disease, adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes, and cancer. Concordance with experimental animal data exists for many of these effects. However, information on modes of action and adverse outcome pathways must be expanded, and profound differences in PFAS toxicokinetic properties must be considered in understanding differences in responses between the sexes and among species and life stages. With many health effects noted for a relatively few example compounds and hundreds of other PFAS in commerce lacking toxicity data, more contemporary and high‐throughput approaches such as read‐across, molecular dynamics, and protein modeling are proposed to accelerate the development of toxicity information on emerging and legacy PFAS, individually and as mixtures. In addition, an appropriate degree of precaution, given what is already known from the PFAS examples noted, may be needed to protect human health.\n              Environ Toxicol Chem\n              2021;40:606–630. © 2020 SETAC",

    "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic, organic chemicals that resist environmental breakdown. The properties that made PFAS into an industrial success also led to their persistence and bioaccumulation. As PFAS were widely used for many decades their presence is evident globally, and their persistence and potential for toxicity create concern for human, animal and environmental health. Following the precautionary principle, a reduction in human exposure is generally recommended. The most significant source of human exposure to PFAS is dietary intake (food and water) with additional exposure via dust. As PFAS concentrations have been more frequently studied in aquatic food sources, there is less understanding of exposure via terrestrial animals. To further define human exposure via animal products, it is necessary to determine PFAS concentrations and persistence in terrestrial livestock and game species. Studies assessing ambient concentrations of PFAS have noted that, aside from point sources of contamination, there is generally low input of PFAS into terrestrial agricultural food chains. However, livestock and game species may be exposed to PFAS via contaminated water, soil, substrate, air or food, and the contribution of these exposures to PFAS concentrations in food products is less well studied. This review focuses on perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAAs) and compiles information from terrestrial livestock and game species as a source of dietary exposure in humans, and discusses toxicokinetics and health effects in animals, while identifying future focus areas. Publications describing the transfer of PFAAs to farmed and hunted animals are scarce, and demonstrate large variability in distribution and elimination. We outline several relatively small, short-term studies in cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry. While negative effects have not been noted, the poultry investigations were the only studies to explicitly assess health effects. Comparative information is presented on PFAA concentrations in livestock products and edible tissues of game animals.",

    "Abstract": "Column percolation tests may be suitable for prediction of chemical leaching from soil and soil materials. However, compared with batch leaching tests, they are time-consuming. It is therefore important to investigate ways to shorten the tests without affecting the quality of results. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of decreasing testing time by increasing flow rate and decreasing equilibration time compared to the conditions specified in ISO/TS 21268-3, with equilibration periods of 48h and flow rate of 12mL/h. We tested three equilibration periods (0, 12⿿16, and 48h) and two flow rates (12 and 36mL/h) on four different soils and compared the inorganic constituent releases. For soils A and D, we observed similar values for all conditions except for the 0h⿿36mL/h case. For soil B, we observed no appreciable differences between the tested conditions, while for soil C there were no consistent trends probably due to the difference in ongoing oxidation reactions between soil samples. These results suggest that column percolation tests can be shortened from 20 to 30days to 7⿿9days by decreasing the equilibration time to 12⿿16h and increasing the flow rate to 36mL/h for inorganic substances.",

The utilisation of alternative water sources like reclaimed municipal wastewater is one of the most obvious and promising options in integrated water resources management. Among the various beneficial uses of reclaimed wastewater Aquifer Recharge (AR) receives growing attention because it features advantages such as additional natural treatment, storage capacity to buffer seasonal variations of supply and demand as well as mixing with natural water bodies which promotes the acceptance of further uses, particularly indirect potable use. Major concerns about the safety of this exploitation route of an alternative water source are connected to microbial and chemical contaminants occurring in wastewater, among which are emerging trace organics like endocrine disrupters and pharmaceuticals.

The pyrolysis temperature of 350°C was found as critical upper temperature in the production of biochar used as fuel. The VP and OP were seen to be more suitable than PL and AB for solid fuel production. The stable carbon contents of biochars produced at 500°C and 600°C were over than 98%. With increasing of pyrolysis temperature, plant nutrients (except K) in biochars become less available to plants. Although the carbon exchange capacity was the highest in AB and PL biochars, they had extremely high electrical conductivity values.",

    "Abstract": "Biomass is considered to have potential to be used as an alternative energy source. High carbon content present in biomass converts it into high energy biochar on thermochemical treatment. Among few well established thermochemical technologies for the treatment of biomass and biogenic waste to produce high energy char along with oil and gaseous yield, pyrolysis is the most studied and discussed technique in the recent past. A comparison between the existing techniques is established in the present work. Production of char from the biomass and biogenic wastes is reviewed and it was found that yield of the biochar depends upon the biomass composition like moisture content and presence of cellulose or lignin. Pyrolysis product distribution and their quality strongly depend upon the process parameters. Different biomasses which can be used as raw material in pyrolysis are also reviewed and categorized depending upon their source. Pyrolysis process parameters such as temperature, heating rate, residence time etc. also influence the biochar yield. This study discusses the effect of these process parameters on the production of biochar through pyrolysis of biomass.",

    "Abstract": "Biochar is a pyrogenous, organic material synthesized through pyrolysis of different biomass (plant or animal waste). The potential biochar applications include: (1) pollution remediation due to high CEC and specific surface area; (2) soil fertility improvement on the way of liming effect, enrichment in volatile matter and increase of pore volume, (3) carbon sequestration due to carbon and ash content, etc. Biochar properties are affected by several technological parameters, mainly pyrolysis temperature and feedstock kind, which differentiation can lead to products with a wide range of values of pH, specific surface area, pore volume, CEC, volatile matter, ash and carbon content. High pyrolysis temperature promotes the production of biochar with a strongly developed specific surface area, high porosity, pH as well as content of ash and carbon, but with low values of CEC and content of volatile matter. This is most likely due to significant degree of organic matter decomposition. Biochars produced from animal litter and solid waste feedstocks exhibit lower surface areas, carbon content, volatile matter and high CEC compared to biochars produced from crop residue and wood biomass, even at higher pyrolysis temperatures. The reason for this difference is considerable variation in lignin and cellulose content as well as in moisture content of biomass. The physicochemical properties of biochar determine application of this biomaterial as an additive to improve soil quality. This review succinctly presents the impact of pyrolysis temperature and the type of biomass on the physicochemical characteristics of biochar and its impact on soil fertility.",

Results indicated that the amount of nutrients needed for biomass growth does not follow the conventional organics to nutrients ratio (COD:N:P) of 100:5:1 when dealing with high-strength organics wastewater. The highest removal efficiency was achieved at COD:N:P ratio of 100:2.8:0.4, where COD, TN, and P removal was 98.8 ± 0.3%, 100.0 ± 0.0%, and 99.3 ± 1.0%, respectively. Moreover, the presence of high amounts of organics led to the dominance of the fast-growing heterotrophs in all SBRs, with the genus Thauera identified as the most abundant genera (23-40%), while autotrophic nitrifiers disappeared. The observed biomass yield at COD:N ratio of 100:2.8 suggested that heterotrophic nitrification may have occurred, while at COD:N ratios of 100:4.4 and 100:5, all the nitrogen was used for biomass synthesis. Moreover, at COD:N ratio of 100:5, almost 1/5 of the organics were utilized by the biomass cells to produce EPS as defensive action against the effects of free ammonia. Batch optimization experiments showed that the fastest rate of removal occurred at COD:N:P ratio of 100:1.1:0.4. After 4 h, the COD, TN, and P removal efficiencies were 95%, 99%, and 96%, achieving overall removal efficiencies of 98%, 100%, and 97% respectively, at HRT of 8 h. The bacterial behavior in consuming the organics was altered under nutrient-deficient conditions, where faster degradation rates were observed as the amounts of nutrients decreased, with higher relative abundance of heterotrophs and diazotrophic bacterial populations.",

    "Abstract": "Interstage mass balance analyses were performed to assess the fate of 15 PFAS in two full-scale wastewater sludge-handling systems. Both systems consisted of thickening (rotary drum, gravity, and dissolved air flotation), anaerobic digestion, and dewatering, while one of them also included primary sludge fermentation. On a mass concentration basis, PFOS was the most abundant compound in both systems, with concentrations as high as 12.9 μg/kg and 53 ng/L in solid and liquid samples, respectively. On a molar basis, PFOS was the most abundant compound in solid samples (up to ∼26,000 picomol/kg), while PFBA was the most abundant compound in liquid samples (up to ̃ 140 picomol/L). Fermentation (a sludge retention time of 4 days) did not cause a significant change in PFAS mass flows. In contrast, anaerobic digestion (sludge retention times of 45 and 20 days) resulted in mass flow increases for 12 PFAAs and mass flow decreases for three precursors. Precursor transformation and PFAA formation increased with the sludge retention time of the digesters. In the liquid–solid separation processes (thickening and dewatering), PFAS with carbon chain lengths of <C7 were mostly present (between 50 and 86%) in the liquid recycle streams, whereas PFAS with chain lengths of ≥C7 were mostly present (between 50 and 121%) in the solid streams. In terms of the PFAS fate at a system-wide scale, over 50% of the mass of each <C6 compound exited both systems via liquid streams, while over 50% of the mass of each ≥C6 compound exited the systems via the biosolids stream. Collectively, the results demonstrated that the fate of PFAS in sludge-handling systems is likely dependent upon the processes employed and their retention time, as well as the physicochemical properties of PFAS. The results also demonstrated that a thorough interstage mass balance analysis of an entire sludge-handling system could provide insights into the impact of individual processes on the PFAS fate and also identify opportunities where interventions might be introduced to remove PFAS from the urban water cycle.",

    "Abstract": "Life cycle assessments (LCAs) were performed for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) treatment with ion exchange (IX) followed by electrochemical oxidation (EO). For the studied water quality, the global warming potentials (GWPs) for two orders of removal of perfluorooctane sulfonic and perfluorooctanoic acids from 1000 m3 water samples were 72.2 and 84.9 kg CO2 eq., respectively. The major contributors to the GWP were electricity and resin manufacturing. To understand the environmental impacts of different treatment options, the following scenarios are compared: single use of the IX resin followed by incineration (IX + Incin.), single use of the IX resin followed by EO (IX + EO), and regeneration and reuse of the IX resin followed by EO (IX/Re + EO). When the EE/O is less than 192 kWh/m3, the GWPs of the three scenarios are in the order of IX/Re + EO < IX + EO < IX + Incin. When the EE/O is larger than 695 kWh/m3, the order is IX + Incin. < IX/Re + EO < IX + EO. When the EE/O is in the middle of the two numbers, the order is IX/Re + EO < IX + Incin. < IX + EO. A greener energy mix favors the EO options and increases these two numbers. An empirical equation was introduced to estimate the overall GWP of PFAS removal based on the EE/O and adsorption isotherms.",

    "Abstract": "Per-and poly fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) used at firefighting training facilities (FTF) contaminate waterbodies and pose a threat to human health and the environment worldwide . In this study, leaching of PFAS from historically AFFF contaminated field soil has been investigated under saturated conditions using up-flow columns for four soil samples with varying PFAS concentrations to quantify the long-term release potential of the source zone. PFOS was the most abundant PFAS present in the soils (84–98% of ΣPFAS12), varying from 358 to 1097 µg/kg and the total organic carbon (TOC) content varied from 0.73 to 2.0%. The experiment was run until a liquid to solid (L/S) ratio of 10 was reached (equivalent to 80 pore volumes or approximately 100 years of natural infiltration at the sampled field site). Results show a general trend of decreasing concentrations of short chain PFAS with increasing leaching volume. However, PFOS concentrations initially increased by 45–87% in three samples with relatively low TOC (0.7, 1.0 and 1.4%), before being reduced. In the 2.0% TOC soil PFOS concentrations continued to increase throughout the experiment. The residual PFOS content in the four soil samples showed no correlation with TOC content in the soil. Up to 50% of the initial PFOS content was retained in the soil with the lowest TOC content (0.7%), whereas all PFOS was removed in the soil with a TOC content of 1.4%. It is hypothesized that DOC present in the eluates originates from other non-fluorinated components present in AFFF that can facilitate PFAS leaching.",

    "Abstract": "Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) can be detected worldwide in both, soil and water. In order to study the leaching behavior of this heterogeneous group of compounds in soil, flow-through column experiments have been conducted. Ten perfluoro carboxylates and four perfluoro sulfonates ranging from C4 to C14 in chain length, and contaminated sewage sludge, have been used to spike a standard soil. The aqueous column effluent was analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with direct injection. The observed percolation velocity seems to be strongly correlated with the length of the perfluorinated chain. Other factors that additionally contribute to the leaching behavior are the functional group of the PFC, the organic carbon content of the soil and the presence of other adsorbates. A mass balance calculation showed that perfluorobutanoic acid can adsorb strongly to the soil, when no PFC with longer carbon chain are present. Only about 60% of the added perfluorobutanoic acid could be detected in the percolate water. The missing amount started to elute again when longer chain PFC or stearate were added to the soil. Thus it would appear that larger and more lipophilic molecules can displace shorter PFC from their binding sites in the soil. The results of a monitoring study using 32 surface water samples and 150 groundwater samples confirm that the PFC with the highest concentrations in groundwater are the short chain PFC with less than 7 (fluorinated) carbon atoms. The dominating PFC in surface waters are perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid.",

    "Abstract": "The evaluation of PFAS immobilization performance in laboratory experiments, especially the long-term stability, is a challenge. To contribute to the development of adequate experimental procedures, the impact of experimental conditions on the leaching behavior was studied. Three experiments on different scales were compared: batch, saturated column, and variably saturated laboratory lysimeter experiments. The Infinite Sink (IS) test – a batch test with repeated sampling – was applied for PFAS for the first time. Soil from an agricultural field amended with paper-fiber biosolids polluted with various perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs; 655 μg/kg ∑18PFAAs) and polyfluorinated precursors (1.4 mg/kg ∑18precursors) was used as the primary material (N-1). Two types of PFAS immobilization agents were tested: treatment with activated carbon-based additives (soil mixtures: R-1 and R-2), and solidification with cement and bentonite (R-3). In all experiments, a chain-length dependent immobilization efficacy is observed. In R-3, the leaching of short-chain PFAAs was enhanced relative to N-1. In column and lysimeter experiments with R-1 and R-2, delayed breakthrough of short-chain PFAAs (C4) occurred (> 90 days; in column experiments at liquid-to-solid ratio (LS) > 30 L/kg) with similar temporal leaching rates suggesting that leaching in these cases was a kinetically controlled process. Observed differences between column and lysimeter experiments may be attributed to varying saturation conditions. In IS experiments, PFAS desorption from N-1, R-1, and R-2 is higher than in the column experiments (N-1: +44 %; R-1: +280 %; R-2: +162 %), desorption of short-chain PFAS occurred predominantly in the initial phase (< 14 days). Our findings demonstrate that sufficient operating times are essential in percolation experiments, e.g., in column experiments >100 days and LS > 30 L/kg. IS experiments may provide a faster estimate for nonpermanent immobilization. The comparison of experimental data from various experiments is beneficial to evaluate PFAS immobilization and to interpret leaching characteristics.",

    "Abstract": "Soil contaminated with aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs) containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) at firefighting training sites has become a major concern worldwide. To date, most studies have focused on assessing soil–water partitioning behavior of PFASs and the key factors that can affect their sorption, whereas PFASs leaching from contaminated soils have not yet been widely investigated. This study evaluated the leaching and desorption of a wide range of PFASs from twelve contaminated soils using the Australian Standard Leaching Procedure (ASLP), the U.S. EPA Multiple Extraction Procedure (MEP), and Leaching Environmental Assessment Framework (LEAF). All three leaching tests provided a similar assessment of PFAS leaching behavior. Leaching of PFASs from soils was related to C-chain lengths and their functional head groups. While short-chain (CF2 ≤ 6) PFASs were easily desorbed and leached, long-chain PFASs were more difficult to desorb. PFASs with a carboxylate head group were leached more readily and to a greater extent than those with a sulfonate or sulfonamide head group. Leaching of long-chain PFASs was pH-dependent where leaching increased at high pH, while leaching of short-chain PFASs was less sensitive to pH. Comparing different leaching tests showed that the results using the alkaline ASLP were similar to the cumulative MEP data and the former might be more practical for routine use than the MEP. No single soil property was adequately able to describe PFAS leaching from the soils. Overall, the PFAS chemical structure appeared to have a greater effect on PFAS leaching from soil than soil physicochemical properties.",

While discussion of mitigation options has included the degree of risk reduction and the cost of treatment, indirect environmental effects are missing from the conversation. Until other technologies are developed, water treatment in Maine will likely rely on the established, energy-intensive method of PFAS adsorption (binding) to granular activated carbon. We conducted an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions associated with water treatment using this treatment media to fill gaps in the discussion. We found that greenhouse gas emissions for water treatment to bring PFAS down to the current interim standard are substantial, raising the footprint of an average user by 6.7–18 percent. We use this information to discuss implications for policymaking.",

    "Abstract": "Extensive use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has caused their ubiquitous presence in natural waters. One of the standard practices for PFAS removal from water is adsorption onto granular activated carbon (GAC); however, this approach generates a new waste stream, i.e., PFAS-laden GAC. Considering the recalcitrance of PFAS molecules in the environment, inadequate disposal (e.g., landfill or incineration) of PFAS-laden GAC may let PFAS back into the aquatic cycle. Therefore, developing approaches for PFAS-laden GAC management present unique opportunities to break its forever circulation within the aqueous environment. This comprehensive review evaluates the past two decades of research on conventional thermal regeneration of GAC and critically analyzes and summarizes the literature on regeneration of PFAS-laden GACs. Optimized thermal regeneration of PFAS-laden GACs may provide an opportunity to employ existing regeneration infrastructure to mineralize the adsorbed PFAS and recover the spent GAC. The specific objectives of this review are (i) to investigate the role of physicochemical properties of PFAS on thermal regeneration, (ii) to assess the changes in regeneration yield as well as GAC physical and chemical structure upon thermal regeneration, and (iii) to critically discuss regeneration parameters controlling the process. This literature review on the engineered regeneration process illustrates the significant promise of this approach that can break the endless environmental cycle of these forever chemicals, while preserving the desired physicochemical properties of the valuable GAC adsorbent.",

    "Abstract": "PFASs are widely distributed in natural and living environment and can enter human bodies via different routes. Many studies have reported that PFASs may be associated with human diseases, such as urine acid and thyroid diseases. In this study, we reviewed PFAS levels in human bodies reported in past seven years, including blood, urine, milk, and tissues (hair and nails). Most studies focused on human blood. Blood type, spatiality, human age, and gender were found to have a strong relationship with PFAS levels in blood samples. The PFAS distribution in urine samples was reported to be associated with the chain length of PFASs and human gender. Urinary excretion was found to be an important pathway of PFAS elimination. PFAS levels in human milk might be affected by various factors, such as mothers' age, dietary habit, parity of mothers and the interval of interpregnancy. Data in hair and nails remain very limited, but these matrices offer a non-invasive approach to evaluate human exposure to PFASs.",

    "Abstract": "PFASs are a class of compounds that include perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, some of the most persistent pollutants still allowed - or only partially restricted - in several product fabrications and industrial applications worldwide. PFASs have been shown to interact with blood proteins and are suspected of causing a number of pathological responses, including cancer. Given this threat to living organisms, we carried out a broad review of possible sources of PFASs and their potential accumulation in agricultural plants, from where they can transfer to humans through the food chain. Analysis of the literature indicates a direct correlation between PFAS concentrations in soil and bioaccumulation in plants. Furthermore, plant uptake largely changes with chain length, functional group, plant species and organ. Low accumulations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) have been found in peeled potatoes and cereal seeds, while short-chain compounds can accumulate at high levels in leafy vegetables and fruits. Significant variations in PFAS buildup in plants according to soil amendment are also found, suggesting a particular interaction with soil organic matter. Here, we identify a series of challenges that PFASs pose to the development of a safe agriculture for future generations.",

    "Abstract": "Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are synthetic chemicals with a variety of industrial and consumer applications that are now widely distributed in the global environment. Here, we report the measurement of six perfluorocarboxylates (PFCA, C4–C9) in a firn (granular compressed snow) core collected from a non-coastal, high-altitude site in Dronning Maud Land in Eastern Antarctica. Snow accumulation of the extracted core dated from 1958 to 2017, a period coinciding with the advent, use, and geographical shift in the global industrial production of poly/perfluoroalkylated substances, including PFAA. We observed increasing PFCA accumulation in snow over this time period, with chemical fluxes peaking in 2009–2013 for perfluorooctanoate (PFOA, C8) and nonanoate (PFNA, C9) with little evidence of a decline in these chemicals despite supposed recent global curtailments in their production. In contrast, the levels of perfluorobutanoate (PFBA, C4) increased markedly since 2000, with the highest fluxes in the uppermost snow layers. These findings are consistent with those previously made in the Arctic and can be attributed to chlorofluorocarbon replacements (e.g., hydrofluoroethers) as an inadvertent consequence of global regulation.",

    "Abstract": "Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are increasingly investigated due to their global occurrence and potential human health risk. The ban on PFOA and PFOS has led to the use of novel substitutes such as GenX, F-53B and OBS. This paper reviews the studies on the occurrence, transformation and remediation of major PFAS i.e. PFOA, PFNA, PFBA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFBS and the three substitutes in groundwater. The data indicated that PFOA, PFBA, PFOS and PFBS were present at high concentrations up to 21,200 ng L−1 while GenX and F-53B were found up to 30,000 ng L−1 and 0.18–0.59 ng L−1, respectively. PFAS in groundwater are from direct sources e.g. surface water and soil. PFAS remediation methods based on membrane, redox, sorption, electrochemical and photocatalysis are analyzed. Overall, photocatalysis is considered to be an ideal technology with low cost and high degradation efficacy for PFAS removal. Photocatalysis could be combined with electrochemical or membrane filtration to become more advantageous. GenX, F-53B and OBS in groundwater treatment by UV/sulfite system and electrochemical oxidation proved effective. The review identified gaps such as the immobilization and recycling of materials in groundwater treatment, and recommended visible light photocatalysis for future studies.",

    "Abstract": "To better understand the fate of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) during conventional and advanced wastewater treatment, 42 PFAS (C3–C14 perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), C3–C10 perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs), per- and polyfluoroethers, and perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) precursors) were investigated through the treatment trains at two municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) using a targeted analysis, the total oxidizable precursor (TOP) assay, and the estimation of partitioning to sludge. Short-chain (C3–C7) PFAAs were found in higher concentrations in wastewater samples, while long-chain (≥C8) PFAAs dominated in sludge samples. PFAA concentrations were elevated by the wastewater treatment processes, particularly after biological treatment (191.3 and 185.1% increases of PFAAs at WWTP-A and B). After TOP oxidation, PFCAs, particularly short-chain ones, increased considerably (up to 311.4 and 409.3% increases of PFCAs at WWTP-A and B). The study results indicated that the transformation of precursors into shorter chain PFAAs by biological treatment and the partitioning of longer chain PFAS into sludge streams are key factors determining the fate of PFAS in WWTPs. With the increasing impact of short-chain PFAS over time, future research should focus on the evaluation of the fate and distribution of historical and emerging PFAS in WWTPs.",

    "Abstract": "High-resolution mass spectrometry was used to screen for emerging per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) in precipitation samples collected in summer 2019 at seven sites in the United States. We previously quantified the concentration of ten PFAS in the rainwater samples using the method of isotopic dilution (Pike et al., 2021). Nine of these targeted analytes belonged to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Regional Screening Level list, herein referred to as EPA-monitored analytes. In this new work, we identify emerging PFAS compounds by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Several emerging PFAS were detected across all samples, with the most prevalent compounds being C3–C8 hydrogen-substituted perfluorocarboxylic acids (H-PFCAs) and fluorotelomer carboxylic acids (FTCAs). Concentrations of emerging PFAS were in the 10–1000 ng L−1 range (approximately 1–2 orders of magnitude greater than EPA-monitored PFAS) at all sites except Wooster, OH, where concentrations were even higher, with a maximum estimated ΣPFAS of 16 400 ng L−1. The elevated levels of emerging PFAS in the Wooster samples were predominantly even and odd chain-length H-PFCAs and FTCAs comprised of complex mixtures of branched isomers. This unique composition did not match any known manufactured PFAS formulation reported to date, but it could represent thermally transformed by-products emitted by a local point source. Overall, the results indicate that PFAS outside of the standard analyte lists make up a significant and previously unappreciated fraction of contaminants in rainwater collected within the central U.S.—and potentially world-wide—especially in proximity to localized point sources.",

    "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) used in various industrial applications are pollutants of concern for the environment and human health. Drinking water consumption is one key exposure pathway to PFAS, as recently highlighted by multiple studies on their occurrence in tap and bottled water worldwide. However, PFAS quantification at low part-per-trillion (ng/L) or part-per-quadrillion (pg/L) concentrations remains challenging. PFAS presence in blanks and incomplete method recoveries can lead to false positives or negatives; PFAS concentration changes under different storage durations or conditions can also affect accuracy and precision. Here, we review the most recent data related to analytical methods that were used in research articles for the detection and quantification of PFAS from drinking water. Commonly encountered pitfalls are summarized, and analytical performance is appraised including detection limits, recovery, matrix effects, and other quality assurance/quality control endpoints. In addition, we collated available guidelines for health advisory levels of PFAS in tap water. Finally, we compiled concentration data on legacy and emerging PFAS in tap and bottled water.",

    "Abstract": "Zwitterionic, cationic, and anionic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are increasingly reported in terrestrial and aquatic environments, but their inputs to agricultural lands are not fully understood. Here, we characterized PFAS in 47 organic waste products (OWP) applied in agricultural fields of France, including historical and recent materials. Overall, 160 PFAS from 42 classes were detected from target screening and homologue-based nontarget screening. Target PFAS were low in agriculture-derived wastes such as pig slurry, poultry manure, or dairy cattle manure (median ∑46PFAS: 0.66 μg/kg dry matter). Higher PFAS levels were reported in urban and industrial wastes, paper mill sludge, sewage sludge, or residual household waste composts (median ∑46PFAS: 220 μg/kg). Historical municipal biosolids and composts (1976–1998) were dominated by perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), N-ethyl perfluorooctanesulfonamido acetic acid (EtFOSAA), and cationic and zwitterionic electrochemical fluorination precursors to PFOS. Contemporaneous urban OWP (2009–2017) were rather dominated by zwitterionic fluorotelomers, which represented on average 55% of ∑160PFAS (max: 97%). The fluorotelomer sulfonamidopropyl betaines (X:2 FTSA-PrB, median: 110 μg/kg, max: 1300 μg/kg) were the emerging class with the highest occurrence and prevalence in contemporary urban OWP. They were also detected as early as 1985. The study informs for the first time that urban sludges and composts can be a significant repository of zwitterionic and cationic PFAS.",

    "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of water-soluble chemical compounds with an important number of applications, which have been widely used during the last 60 years. Two of them, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), are the most known and well investigated. As for many other organic substances that are of environmental concern, the diet is the main route of human exposure to PFAS. However, in certain cases drinking water may also mean a significant contribution to human exposure, and to a lesser extent, dust and air (indoor exposure). In recent years, the environmental persistence of PFAS, their biomagnification in food webs, as well as their potential accumulation and toxicity, have generated a notable interest, which has been evidenced by the considerable number of publications in this regard. Recently, we carried out a wide revision on the levels of PFAS in food and human dietary intake. In the current review, we have summarized the recent information (last 10 years) published in the scientific literature (Scopus and PubMed) on the concentrations of PFAS in drinking water and the human health risks derived from the regular water consumption, when available. A large amount of data belongs to PFOS and PFOA and corresponds to studies mainly conducted in countries of the European Union, USA and China, although no information is available for most countries over the world. According to the toxicological information about PFAS that is so far available, the current health risks for the regular consumers of municipal/tap water do not seem to be of concern according to the levels considered as acceptable for various regulatory institutions.",

    "Abstract": "This article reviews perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) characteristics, their occurrence in surface water, and their fate in drinking water treatment processes. PFASs have been detected globally in the aquatic environment including drinking water at trace concentrations and due, in part, to their persistence in human tissue some are being investigated for regulation. They are aliphatic compounds containing saturated carbon–fluorine bonds and are resistant to chemical, physical, and biological degradation. Functional groups, carbon chain length, and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity are some of the important structural properties of PFASs that affect their fate during drinking water treatment. Full-scale drinking water treatment plant occurrence data indicate that PFASs, if present in raw water, are not substantially removed by most drinking water treatment processes including coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, biofiltration, oxidation (chlorination, ozonation, AOPs), UV irradiation, and low pressure membranes. Early observations suggest that activated carbon adsorption, ion exchange, and high pressure membrane filtration may be effective in controlling these contaminants. However, branched isomers and the increasingly used shorter chain PFAS replacement products may be problematic as it pertains to the accurate assessment of PFAS behaviour through drinking water treatment processes since only limited information is available for these PFASs.",

    "Abstract": "Environmental scientists play a key role in society's responses to environmental problems, and many of the studies they perform are intended ultimately to affect policy. The precautionary principle, proposed as a new guideline in environmental decision making, has four central components: taking preventive action in the face of uncertainty; shifting the burden of proof to the proponents of an activity; exploring a wide range of alternatives to possibly harmful actions; and increasing public participation in decision making. In this paper we examine the implications of the precautionary principle for environmental scientists, whose work often involves studying highly complex, poorly understood systems, while at the same time facing conflicting pressures from those who seek to balance economic growth and environmental protection. In this complicated and contested terrain, it is useful to examine the methodologies of science and to consider ways that, without compromising integrity and objectivity, research can be more or less helpful to those who would act with precaution. We argue that a shift to more precautionary policies creates opportunities and challenges for scientists to think differently about the ways they conduct studies and communicate results. There is a complicated feedback relation between the discoveries of science and the setting of policy. While maintaining their objectivity and focus on understanding the world, environmental scientists should be aware of the policy uses of their work and of their social responsibility to do science that protects human health and the environment. The precautionary principle highlights this tight, challenging linkage between science and policy.",

    "Abstract": "Wastewater is water that has already been contaminated by domestic, industrial and commercial activity that needs to be treated before it could be discharged into some other water bodies to avoid even more groundwater contamination supplies. It consists of various contaminants like heavy metals, organic pollutants, inorganic pollutants and Emerging contaminants. Research has been doing on all types of contaminates more than a decade, but this emerging contaminants is the contaminants which arises mostly from pharmaceuticals, personal care products, hormones and fertilizer industries. The majority of emerging contaminants did not have standardized guidelines, but may have adverse effects on human and marine organisms, even at smaller concentrations. Typically, extremely low doses of emerging contaminants are found in the marine environment and cause a potential risk to the aquatic animals living there. When contaminants emerge in the marine world, they are potentially toxic and pose many risks to the health of both man and livestock. The aim of this article is to review the Emerging contaminate sources, detection methods and treatment methods. The purpose of this study is to consider the adsorption as a beneficial treatment of emerging contaminants also advanced and cost effective emerging contaminates treatment methods.",

    "Abstract": "Chlorine-based disinfection for drinking water treatment (DWT) was one of the 20th century’s great public health achievements, as it substantially reduced the risk of acute microbial waterborne disease. However, today’s chlorinated drinking water is not unambiguously safe; trace levels of regulated and unregulated disinfection byproducts (DBPs), and other known, unknown, and emerging contaminants (KUECs), present chronic risks that make them essential removal targets. Because conventional chemical-based DWT processes do little to remove DBPs or KUECs, alternative approaches are needed to minimize risks by removing DBP precursors and KUECs that are ubiquitous in water supplies. We present the “Minus Approach” as a toolbox of practices and technologies to mitigate KUECs and DBPs without compromising microbiological safety. The Minus Approach reduces problem-causing chemical addition treatment (i.e., the conventional “Plus Approach”) by producing biologically stable water containing pathogens at levels having negligible human health risk and substantially lower concentrations of KUECs and DBPs. Aside from ozonation, the Minus Approach avoids primary chemical-based coagulants, disinfectants, and advanced oxidation processes. The Minus Approach focuses on bank filtration, biofiltration, adsorption, and membranes to biologically and physically remove DBP precursors, KUECs, and pathogens; consequently, water purveyors can use ultraviolet light at key locations in conjunction with smaller dosages of secondary chemical disinfectants to minimize microbial regrowth in distribution systems. We describe how the Minus Approach contrasts with the conventional Plus Approach, integrates with artificial intelligence, and can ultimately improve the sustainability performance of water treatment. Finally, we consider barriers to adoption of the Minus Approach.",

    "Abstract": "Phosphate in wastewater can be recovered in the form of struvite crystals for use as slow-release fertilizer. Currently, struvite recovery often requires supplementing magnesium ions and raising pH with chemicals, making the recovered struvite unfavorable for organic production. In an effort for cleaner production, this study developed a versatile approach employing two mineral products in variable combinations for optimal supplementation of magnesium and elevation of pH. Magnesite, a mineral of MgCO3, was ground and calcined without use of any catalysts. The magnesite calcined under the optimum conditions (800 °C for 30 min) can be dissolved in near-neutral filtrate of sludge digestate to supplement magnesium and raise pH for effective struvite formation. The OMRI-listed Epsom salts (MgSO4∙7H2O), mineral-based water-soluble commercial products, can be used to supplement magnesium without changing pH of alkaline wastewater. Six-hour batch operation of an air-lift crystallizer removed 85.7% and 94.7% of phosphate in hydrolyzed human urine when magnesium was amended to 1.2 × molar concentration of phosphate with calcined magnesite and an OMRI-listed Epsom salt, respectively. More than 98% of phosphate was removed from filtrate of sludge digestate in 3-h batch operation using calcined magnesite to raise pH to 8.5 and the Epsom salt for further magnesium supplementation. Struvite accounted for 85.7%, 90.5%, and 81.5% of the crystals recovered from urine with calcined magnesite, urine with Epsom salt, and filtrate with both mineral products, respectively. The material and energy costs of this green process were estimated to be $0.16/kg struvite from urine with calcined magnesite, $1.37/kg struvite from urine with Epsom salt, and $0.94/kg struvite from filtrate with both mineral products.

    "Abstract": "The undisclosed and ubiquitous use of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in consumer products has led to a growing issue of environmental pollution, particularly within the solid waste community, where the fate of volatile (neutral) PFAS in landfilled refuse is not well understood. Here, three municipal solid waste landfills in Florida were assessed for neutral PFAS in landfill gas and ionic PFAS in landfill leachate to compare the relative mobility between the two pathways. Landfill gas was directly sampled using a high volume, XAD-2 resin based sampling approach developed for adsorption and analysis of 27 neutral PFAS. Across sites, 13 neutral PFAS were identified from fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH), fluorotelomer olefin (FTO), secondary FTOH, fluorotelomer acetate (FTOAc), and fluorotelomer methyl acrylate (FTMAc) classes; however, FTOHs dominated concentrations (87–97% total neutral PFAS), with most detections surpassing utilized calibration levels. Even under conservative assumptions, the mass of fluorine leaving in landfill gas (32–76%) was comparable to or greater than the mass leaving in landfill leachate (24–68%). These findings suggest that landfill gas, a less scrutinized byproduct, serves as a major pathway for the mobility of PFAS from landfills.",

    "Abstract": "Soils are impacted globally by several anthropogenic factors, including chemical pollutants. Among those, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are of concern due to their high environmental persistence, and as they might affect soil structure and function. However, data on impacts of PFAS on soil structure and microbially-driven processes are currently lacking. This study explored the effects of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) at environmental-relevant concentrations on soil health, using a 6-week microcosm experiment. PFAS (even at 0.5 ng g−1 for PFBS) significantly increased litter decomposition, associated with positive effects on β-glucosidase activities. This effect increased with PFAS concentrations. Soil pH was significantly increased, likely as a direct consequence of increased litter decomposition affected by PFAS. Soil respiration was significantly inhibited by PFAS in week 3, while this effect was more variable in week 6. Water-stable aggregates were negatively affected by PFOS, possibly related to microbial shifts. PFAS affected soil bacterial and fungal abundance, but not microbial and certain enzyme activities. Our work highlights the potential effects of PFAS on soil health, and we argue that this substance class could be a factor of environmental change of potentially broad relevance in terrestrial ecosystem functioning.",

    "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been mass-produced and widely applied in consumer and industrial products, resulting in their widespread presence in the environment. Features such as environmental persistence, bioaccumulation, and high toxicity even at low doses have made PFASs an increasing concern. This brief review focuses on soil PFASs, especially the effect of soil PFASs on other environmental media and their potential threats to human health through daily diet. Specifically, soil PFASs contamination caused by different pathways was first investigated. Soil pollution from application of aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs) is generally more severe than that from fluorochemical manufacturing plants, followed by biosolid land use, landfill, and irrigation. Factors, such as carbon chain length of PFASs, wastewater treatment technology, geographical conditions, and regional development level, are related to soil PFASs’ pollution. Then, the migration, bioaccumulation, and toxicity characteristics of soil PFASs were analyzed. Short-chain PFASs have higher solubility, mobility, and bioavailability, while long-chain PFASs have higher bioaccumulation potential and are more toxic to organisms. Factors such as soil texture, solution chemistry conditions, enzymes, and fertilization conditions also influence the environmental behavior of PFASs. The risk of human exposure to PFASs through agricultural and animal products is difficult to control and varies depending on living region, age, eating habits, lifestyle, ethnicity, etc. Soil PFASs threaten drinking water safety, affect soil function, and enter food webs, threatening human health. Knowledge gaps and perspectives in these research fields are also included in current work to assist future research to effectively investigate and understand the environmental risks of soil PFASs, thereby reducing human exposure.",

    "Abstract": "Ashes from sewage sludge incineration are rich in phosphorus content, ranging between 4% and 9%. Due to the current methods of disposal used for these ashes, phosphorus, which is a valuable plant nutrient, is removed from biological cycling. This article proposes the possible three-stage processing of SSA, whereby more than 90% of phosphorus can be extracted to make an adequate phosphate fertilizer. SSA from two Swiss sewage sludge incinerators was used for laboratory investigations. In an initial step, SSA was leached with sulfuric acid using a liquid-to-solid ratio of 2. The leaching time and pH required for high phosphorus dissolution were determined. Inevitably, dissolution of heavy metals takes place that would contaminate the fertilizer. Thus in a second step, leach solution has to be purified by having the heavy metals removed. Both ion exchange using chelating resins and sulfide precipitation turned out to be suitable for removing critical Cu, Ni and Cd. Thirdly, phosphates were precipitated as calcium phosphates with lime water. The resulting phosphate sludge was dewatered, dried and ground to get a powdery fertilizer whose efficacy was demonstrated by plant tests in a greenhouse. By measuring the weight of plants after 6 weeks of growth, fertilized in part with conventional phosphate fertilizer, fertilizer made from SSA was proven to be equal in its plant uptake efficiency.",

PFAS are a group of manufactured chemicals used in industry and consumer products that persist in the environment. Given the growing evidence linking PFAS with adverse health effects in humans, NCEH and ATSDR developed a public health research framework to capture the broad range of PFAS research activities being conducted and supported by the agency to determine future research priorities and identify opportunities for interagency collaboration. The framework was conceptualized via a multidisciplinary visioning process designed to identify compelling questions and research activities that span five scientific domains: toxicology, exposure, human health, public health action, and cross-cutting priorities. This paper presents a framework, compelling questions and research activities to help NCEH and ATSDR advance scientific discovery in partnership with federal, state, and local stakeholders as part of a comprehensive public health response to PFAS contamination.",

    "Abstract": "The Canadian government has been involved in developing regulations and guidance for certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) since the early 2000s. Several federal departments are involved in different aspects of this work. Significant PFAS work is carried out under the Federal Contaminated Sites Action Plan (FCSAP), which provides a structure for the dozens of departments that are implicated in federal contaminated sites management in Canada. The work carried out under FCSAP is largely related to the PFAS resulting from aqueous film forming foams (AFFF) use. The Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) is another program with significant involvement in the assessment and management of certain PFAS. This work includes the publication of screening assessments on perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (LC-PFCAs) which led to their regulation. Risk assessments identify whether a chemical substance poses a risk, and if so, risk managers determine how best to minimise or eliminate the risk to protect the public and the environment. Highlights of work carried out under FCSAP, CMP, and existing regulations are discussed herein. Environmental quality guidelines and drinking water quality guidelines provide benchmarks for the quality of the ambient environment. Canadian federal guidelines or screening values to protect human health are now available for eleven (11) PFAS, while values to protect ecological receptors are available for PFOS. Development of our understanding, including the review of new information on PFAS (those for which guidelines exist and additional substances) is ongoing. Ongoing scientific research and risk management at contaminated sites in Canada have also been part of efforts by multiple federal departments in Canada. In this report, we will outline some of these projects and how they inform the development of additional environmental quality guidelines and advance contaminated sites risk management.",

    "Abstract": "Despite decades of research on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), fundamental obstacles remain to addressing worldwide contamination by these chemicals and their associated impacts on environmental quality and health. Here, we propose six urgent questions relevant to science, technology, and policy that must be tackled to address the “PFAS problem”: (1) What are the global production volumes of PFAS, and where are PFAS used? (2) Where are the unknown PFAS hotspots in the environment? (3) How can we make measuring PFAS globally accessible? (4) How can we safely manage PFAS-containing waste? (5) How do we understand and describe the health effects of PFAS exposure? (6) Who pays the costs of PFAS contamination? The importance of each question and barriers to progress are briefly described, and several potential paths forward are proposed. Given the diversity of PFAS and their uses, the extreme persistence of most PFAS, the striking ongoing lack of fundamental information, and the inequity of the health and environmental impacts from PFAS contamination, there is a need for scientific and regulatory communities to work together, with cooperation from PFAS-related industries, to fill in critical data gaps and protect human health and the environment.",

    "Abstract": "On December 13, 2019, the Yale School of Public Health hosted a symposium titled “Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS): Challenges and Opportunities” in New Haven, Connecticut. The meeting focused on the current state of the science on these chemicals, highlighted the challenges unique to PFAS, and explored promising opportunities for addressing them. It brought together participants from Yale University, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the University of Connecticut, the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, the Connecticut Departments of Public Health and Energy and Environmental Protection, and the public and private sectors. Presentations during the symposium centered around several primary themes. The first reviewed the current state of the science on the health effects associated with PFAS exposure and noted key areas that warranted future research. As research in this field relies on specialized laboratory analyses, the second theme considered commercially available methods for PFAS analysis as well as several emerging analytical approaches that support health studies and facilitate the investigation of a broader range of PFAS. Since mitigation of PFAS exposure requires prevention and cleanup of contamination, the third theme highlighted new nanotechnology-enabled PFAS remediation technologies and explored the potential of green chemistry to develop safer alternatives to PFAS. The fourth theme covered collaborative efforts to assess the vulnerability of in-state private wells and small public water supplies to PFAS contamination by adjacent landfills, and the fifth focused on strategies that promote successful community engagement. This symposium supported a unique interdisciplinary coalition established during the development of Connecticut's PFAS Action Plan, and discussions occurring throughout the symposium revealed opportunities for collaborations among Connecticut scientists, state and local officials, and community advocates. In doing so, it bolstered the State of Connecticut's efforts to implement the ambitious initiatives that its PFAS Action Plan recommends.",

    "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent organic chemicals detected in biosolids worldwide, which have become a significant concern for biosolids applications due to their increasing environmental risks. Hence, it is pivotal to understand the magnitude of PFAS contamination in biosolids and implement effective technologies to reduce their contamination and prevent hazardous aftermaths. Thermal techniques such as pyrolysis, incineration and gasification, and biodegradation have been regarded as impactful solutions to degrade PFAS and transform biosolids into value-added products like biochar. These techniques can mineralize PFAS compounds under specific operating parameters, which can lead to unique degradation mechanisms and pathways. Understanding PFAS degradation mechanisms can pave the way to design the technology and to optimize the process conditions. Therefore, in this review, we aim to review and compare PFAS degradation mechanisms in thermal treatment like pyrolysis, incineration, gasification, smouldering combustion, hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), and biodegradation. For instance, in biodegradation of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), firstly C−S bond cleavage occurs which is followed by hydroxylation, decarboxylation and defluorination reactions to form perfluoroheptanoic acid. In HTL, PFOS degradation is carried through OH−catalyzed series of nucleophilic substitution and decarboxylation reactions. In contrast, thermal PFOS degradation involves a three-step random-chain scission pathway. The first step includes C−S bond cleavage, followed by defluorination of perfluoroalkyl radical, and radical chain propagation reactions. Finally, the termination of chain propagation reactions produces very short-fluorinated units. We also highlighted important policies and strategies employed worldwide to curb PFAS contamination in biosolids.",

    "Abstract": "Municipal solid wastes (MSWs) contain diverse per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and these substances may leach into leachates, resulting in potential threats to the environment and human health. In this study, leachates from incineration plants with on-site treatment systems were measured for 17 PFAS species, including 13 perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and 4 perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs). PFAS were detected in all of the raw leachates and finished effluents in concentrations ranging from 7228 to 16,565 ng L−1 and 43 to 184 ng L−1, respectively, with a greater contribution from the short-chain PFAS and PFCAs. The results showed that the existing combined processes (biological treatment and membrane filtration) were effective in decreasing PFAS in the aqueous phase with removal efficiencies over 95%. In addition, correlation analysis suggested that physical entrapment, not biodegradation, was the main means of PFAS reduction in the treatment system. These results filled a gap in the understanding of PFAS occurrence and removal in leachates from incineration plants during the full-scale treatment processes, and demonstrated those leachates were previously under-explored sources of PFAS.",

Therefore, the study of technologies that can facilitate the deployment of sewage treatment systems becomes essential. In this sense, the objective of this study was to evaluate the energy potential and the economic viability of the operation efficiency of biogas from anaerobic digestion of sewage and sewage sludge in wastewater treatment plants in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Economic analysis was considered for the local legislation that establishes a system of energy compensation for distributed generation. The potential for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) with the application of the methane recovery system was always estimated. For the biogas production calculations, real data on the volume of treated sewage and the population served with sanitary sewage were presented in a report by the local authority. The results indicated that the methane recovery system is feasible in most cities above 50,000 inhabitants, 86% of the municipalities with a population between 50,000 and 150,000 inhabitants, 67% of the municipalities with a population between 150,000 and 250,000 inhabitants and 100% of the municipalities with a population exceeding 250,000 inhabitants; these showed positive NPV and IRR, greater than the rate of attractiveness (8%). The time needed for return on investment (payback) in municipalities where the investment was feasible was 1.25 years for cities with a population of more than 250,000 inhabitants, 4.49 years for cities with a population between 150,000 and 250,000 inhabitants, 2.08 years for cities with a population between 50,000 and 150,000 inhabitants and 7.97 years for cities with a population of less than 50,000 inhabitants. In addition, a potential for electricity generation in the state of Minas Gerais of approximately 47,140 MWh per year and a potential reduction in emissions of GHG close to 325,800 tCO2eq/year with the deployment of the system was identified.",

    "Abstract": "In this work we have performed a feasibility study of two upgrading alternatives for sewage sludge stabilization aimed to the reduction of the produced sludge and to the improvement of its qualitative characteristics with respect to its final destination: agricultural use or incineration. The first upgrading (1) proposes the separated thickening: primary sludge is thickened by gravity while dynamic thickening is applied to secondary sludge. The second upgrading (2) introduces a post-aerobic digestion stage (after the anaerobic one), in addition to separate thickening. Technical-economic and environmental assessments have been performed in comparison to a conventional wastewater treatment plant, which operates with gravity thickening and anaerobic digestion of mixed sludge. In the post-aerobic stage, operated with intermittent aeration, additional volatile solids removal of 45% and nitrification and denitrification efficiencies of 97% and 70%, respectively, were achieved. Both upgrading alternatives gained a positive technical evaluation with the only exceptions of the item “Thermal energy consumption” in upgrading 1 for agricultural reuse, and, to a minor extent, the “Energy available for external recovery” for incineration in both upgrading options. Cost analysis showed that the two upgrading alternatives are generally cheaper than the conventional plant, even if the results are dependent on local conditions, which have to be considered. Results of the environmental assessment showed that the upgrades with incineration perform better than the reference for all impact categories except freshwater eutrophication, with upgrading 2 as the best option. For the agricultural use, different results were obtained for the different impact categories with critical aspects mainly related to phosphorus and ammonia emissions for upgrading 1.",

    "Abstract": "Combining wastewater treatment and biofuel production is considered the cost-effective way for better waste remediation and lowering the environmental impact for biofuel production. In this study, an innovative integrated system incorporating sludge, scum and centrate treatment and biofuel production was developed. A comprehensive techno-economic analysis was conducted to evaluate the technology and economic feasibility of the integrated system with the consideration of biofuel production, wastewater treatment improvement, tax credits, carbon credit, and coproducts utilization. Benefited from the integrated system that the intermediate byproducts can be used in between the sub-systems, such as the glycerol generated from the scum-to-biodiesel production can be used as an organic carbon for the centrate-to-algae production, the estimated breakeven selling price of the bio-oil ($1.85/gallon) is very close to the 5-year averaged crude oil price. The assessment result showed the payback period and the IRRs of the integrated system are superior in comparison with others.",

    "Abstract": "China has more than 2500 industrial parks that are above the provincial level and contribute more than half of the GDP of China. Centralized wastewater treatment plants (CWWTPs) are one of the most important environmental infrastructures of these industrial parks, and their performance and efficiency usually directly influences the pollutants discharged and the surrounding water environment. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a method that has been increasingly popular for assessing the efficiency of wastewater and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in recent decades. In this study, a slack-based DEA (SBM-DEA) model, which includes five input variables and four output variables, is applied to assess the eco-efficiency of 281 CWWTPs in 126 national-level industrial parks (NIPs). Sensitivity analysis is used to identify the most sensitive input and output variables. Next, a Pearson correlation analysis is used to evaluate the correlations between the eco-efficiency factors and some implicit factors, which are not selected as input and output variables but may have an underlying impact on the eco-efficiency of CWWTPs. Then, the uncertainty and limitations of the DEA method, in terms of its ability to assess the efficiency of CWWTPs, are discussed. Finally, the conclusion is presented and some policy suggestions are proposed to improve the eco-efficiency of CWWTPs in NIPs. The key findings will have referential significance of improving eco-efficiencies of industrial parks around the world.",

    "Abstract": "The assessment of the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is essential to compare their performance and consequently to identify the best operational practices that can contribute to the reduction of operational costs. Previous studies have evaluated the efficiency of WWTPs using conventional data envelopment analysis (DEA) models. Most of these studies have considered the operational costs of the WWTPs as inputs, while the pollutants removed from wastewater are treated as outputs. However, they have ignored the fact that each pollutant removed by a WWTP involves a different environmental impact. To overcome this limitation, this paper evaluates for the first time the efficiency of a sample of WWTPs by applying the weighted slacks-based measure model. It is a non-radial DEA model which allows assigning weights to the inputs and outputs according their importance. Thus, the assessment carried out integrates environmental issues with the traditional “techno-economic” efficiency assessment of WWTPs. Moreover, the potential economic savings for each cost item have been quantified at a plant level. It is illustrated that the WWTPs analyzed have significant room to save staff and energy costs. Several managerial implications to help WWTPs' operators make informed decisions were drawn from the methodology and empirical application carried out.",

    "Abstract": "This paper explores the potential of integrated management of neighboring wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The novelty lies in the integration of environmental aspects, with the application of life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, together with economic criteria for the selection of best alternatives. A case study illustrates how the connection of neighboring wastewater systems by constructing an extra pipeline provides positive results in the economic assessment, and in the majority of the LCA categories used in the global environmental assessment. The consideration of local environmental constraints suggests that the usage of the connection should be limited to periods when the minimum ecological flow in the river section between the discharges of the two WWTPs is maintained. In this particular case, the scenario that promotes the usage of the connection between the two WWTPs (but with some restrictions in dry weather periods) is preferred because it provides cost savings of 45,053€·year−1 and satisfies environmental criteria. A scenario analysis has been conducted to evaluate the influence of the pipe length on both economic and environmental aspects and the influence of individual cost terms on the economic assessment.",

    "Abstract": "Renewable energies are being given increasing attention worldwide, as they are able to reduce the dependence on depletable fossil fuels. At the same time, wastewater treatment is known to be a significantly energy-intensive sector, which could potentially exploit renewable energies conversion in different forms. This study investigated the feasibility to design high renewable share wastewater treatment plants through dynamic simulations and optimization, aiming to move towards greener and energy-wise wastewater remediation processes. The main aim of the work was achieved by integrating photovoltaic systems with wind turbines, multi-energy storage technologies, i.e., batteries and hydrogen systems, and reverse osmosis tertiary treatment to absorb the power production surpluses. It was supposed that, in the newly proposed scenario, most of the plant electricity need would be covered by renewable energy. The optimization problem was multi-objective and found the trade-off solutions between minimizing the net present cost and maximizing the renewable share. In the first part of the study, the model was developed and applied to a medium-scale Italian municipal wastewater treatment plant. Model generalization was successively accomplished by applying the model to different locations and plant scales across the world. For all the investigated scenarios and cases, the optimal system integration was to design a renewable and storage system with a renewable share of 70%, corresponding to the lowest net present cost. The developed model is highly flexible and can be applied to other relevant case studies, boosting for a more sustainable wastewater treatment sector, enhancing at the same time local renewable energy conversion.",

    "Abstract": "The environmental benefits and burdens of phosphorus recovery in four centralized and two decentralized municipal wastewater systems were compared using life cycle assessment (LCA). In centralized systems, phosphorus recovered as struvite from the solids dewatering liquid resulted in an environmental benefit except for the terrestrial ecotoxicity and freshwater eutrophication impact categories, with power and chemical use offset by operational savings and avoided fertilizer production. Chemical-based phosphorus recovery, however, generally required more resources than were offset by avoided fertilizers, resulting in a net environmental burden. In decentralized systems, phosphorus recovery via urine source separation reduced the global warming and ozone depletion potentials but increased terrestrial ecotoxicity and salinization potentials due to application of untreated urine to land. Overall, mineral depletion and eutrophication are well-documented arguments for phosphorus recovery; however, phosphorus recovery does not necessarily present a net environmental benefit. While avoided fertilizer production does reduce potential impacts, phosphorus recovery does not necessarily offset the resources consumed in the process. LCA results indicate that selection of an appropriate phosphorus recovery method should consider both local conditions and other environmental impacts, including global warming, ozone depletion, toxicity, and salinization, in addition to eutrophication and mineral depletion impacts.",

    "Abstract": "Small water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) serving communities with populations of less than 10,000 people account for 70% of centralized wastewater treatment systems in the United States. With growing interest globally in improving the sustainability of these systems, this study evaluated the environmental life cycle impact and land use tradeoffs of different lagoon and mechanical WRRFs across the diverse climate of Nebraska. Life cycle inventory including construction and operations was collected for 35 existing systems representing a range of commonly used mechanical WRRFs: oxidation ditch, extended aeration, and sequencing batch reactors, and lagoon treatment systems: complete retention, irrigation, and controlled discharge lagoons. Lagoons exhibit a significantly smaller environmental impact relative to mechanical WRRFs in all impact categories with exception of the smog category based on a 20-year design lifespan provided land is available for use; in contrast, on-site land use of lagoons was significantly higher than mechanical WRRFs, 73.7 ± 35.9 m2/capita and 2.4 ± 1.9 m2/capita, respectively. Lagoons on average exhibited significantly more impact associated with the construction phase in most impact categories (up to 80% in case of smog impacts) relative to mechanical WRRFs (<25%). The differences in contribution of the construction leads to the environmental impacts and comparisons between the technologies being sensitive to system lifespan and type of electric grid mix. Irrigation lagoon per capita excavation and cast-iron resource use was observed to decrease with increasing differences between evaporation and precipitation rates. Uncertainty of the environmental impacts within sites is primarily driven by variations in energy intensity within mechanical WRRFs and volumes of treated water within lagoons. Variability between facilities of similar technology groups is largely driven by a combination of site-specific factors including climate, design, and operations.",

    "Abstract": "Cost benefit analysis (CBA) and social impact assessment are well established methodologies to systematically estimate the viability of investments on technologies as well as the benefits for the society. However, there is a limited application of these assessment methods in the wastewater sector especially for resource recovery to deliver circularity objectives within urban water cycle management. In this regard, the Horizon 2020 SMART-Plant Innovation Action aimed to evaluate holistic impacts of wastewater-based resource recovery by applying and adapting cost benefit and social analysis on innovative technologies (SMARTechs). The SMARTechs were implemented and validated in real wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across Europe and Mediterranean basin where potential impacts in terms of carbon, material and energy efficiency, recovery and safe reuse were defined. Sixteen bottom-up SMARTech scenarios were analysed for the estimation of technical, economic and social impacts using CBA, social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) and social readiness level (SRL) methods. Overall, the SMARTechs created benefits both from an environmental and social point of view, with a maximum relative total economic value up to +23% compared to baseline scenario (without any SMARTech implementation). In terms of social benefits, the S-LCA highlighted a global positive impact of all the SMARTechs in terms of technical characteristics and social acceptance. Specifically, SMARTech 1 (cellulose recovery) was the most socially accepted solution thanks to its high performance and simplicity. Finally, based on the SRL assessment, most of the SMARTechs were positioned within the SRL range of 6–7, which implies a good societal acceptance and adaptation potential.",

    "Abstract": "Wastewater resource recovery has been advocated for decades; necessary structural pathways were long-ago articulated, and established and emerging technologies exist. Nevertheless, broad wastewater valorization remains elusive. In considering implementation barriers, the argument is made that decision-makers focus on avoiding permit violations and negative publicity by embracing a conservative/safe approach–seemingly ignoring research on economic/environmental benefits. Conversely positing that economics is a primary barrier, we investigated, characterized, and described nontechnical socio-political barriers to realizing wastewater resource recovery. Principal actors in the Pacific NW region of the U.S. (representing a progressive populace facing stringent water quality regulations) were interviewed. Results revealed that economics were, indeed, the primary barrier to implementation/expansion of the WRRF concept. Consistent throughout interviews was a prevalent sense that the “cost of doing something (different)” was a principal consideration in resource recovery actions/policies. Moreover, “economics drives decisions,” and “95% the bottom line is money. Show return on investment, it will get people’s attention.” Who pays was also a concern: “Government isn’t going to pay. The states and Federal government won’t give any grants, and we can’t raise rates.” Applying business case evaluations was seen as a pathway to actualizing resource recovery. Most encouragingly, the consensus was that resource recovery is a necessary future paradigm, and that real barriers are surmountable.",

    "Abstract": "A robust and sensitive method for the detection of fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides and trimethoprim has been developed. Wastewater samples were acidified and extracted through an anion-exchange cartridge in tandem with a hydrophilic–lipophilic balance (HLB) cartridge, a procedure that reduced interferences from wastewater organic matter. The extracted antibiotics were analyzed using liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry and selected ion monitoring. Quantification of antibiotics was assessed both by internal standard and standard addition methods. Average recoveries for a range of wastewater matrices were 37 to 129% for a 1μg/L spiking concentration. The method detection limits (MDLs) of antibiotics in deionized water, final and secondary effluent ranged from 2 to 7ng/L, from 20 to 50ng/L, and from 30 to 90ng/L, respectively. Assessment of matrix interference shows that signal suppression and MDL increases with higher amounts of organic matter in the sample. Analyses of samples from two municipal wastewater treatment plants indicate that ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim are present in the secondary effluents at median concentrations of 100–160, 205–305, 395–575, and 40–705ng/L, respectively.",

    "Abstract": "To accommodate the rapidly increasing amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) sustainably and effectively, public-private partnership (PPP) waste-to-energy (WTE) incineration has achieved rapid growth in China. This study provides an insight into current practice and identifies key opportunities and major challenges in the further development of PPP implemented in China's WTE incineration industry. The results show that the public-private-partnership market is currently under a period of rapid expansion, with a large number of well-funded and highly professional public-private partnership suppliers emerging in recent decades, but at a level of market concentration that is significantly lower than in mature markets such as in the United States and Japan. Meanwhile, excellent market potential and preferential policies, as well as booming technological innovations, provide sufficient motivation for further development. However, the quality and quantity of municipal solid waste supplied, emerging public opposition, policy changes and the development dilemmas involved are major challenges to the sustainable and healthy development of the waste-to-energy incineration industry in China. These findings make strong contributions and have both theoretical and practical implications for researchers and practitioners, including policymakers and incineration professionals in the PPP WTE incineration industry.",

    "Abstract": "A novel medical-waste-to-energy design combining plasma gasification (treating medical waste) and municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration has been developed. In the integrated system, the syngas generated by the plasma gasification of medical waste is first burned and drives the gas turbine for power generation, subsequently, the gas turbine exhaust is taken to heat the live steam and feedwater of the MSW incineration plant, improving the power cycle of the incineration plant. Consequently, medical waste can be converted into electricity efficiently in the meantime of harmless management. The hybrid design was investigated by multiple approaches including energy analysis, exergy analysis, and economic analysis. It is found that the energy efficiency and exergy efficiency of medical-waste-to-electricity can reach up to 37.83% and 34.91% with a net total power of 4.24 MW yielded from medical waste, while the net power generated from MSW is considered fixed. Besides, the proposed medical-waste-to-electricity project has a short dynamic payback period of 3.75 years and the relative net present value can achieve 45,239.90 k$. These results demonstrate that the novel concept is efficient, feasible, and advantageous, which is promising to be implemented in the field of waste-to-energy.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper we evaluated the feasibility of energy generation by incineration of waste in Mexico. The population of Mexico was split into six population-size classes, each one associated to a waste generation index. The total amount of waste and the lower calorific values were used to estimate the power and energy resulting from each size class. The economic feasibility was evaluated using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR). For populations up to 3 million inhabitants the incineration of waste resulted in 58.9 MW. The total energy generation resulted in 11,681.64 GWh contributing to 4.3% of the national demand. The NPV and IRR showed negative values per lower sizes of population and the LCOE resulted in higher values than other energy sources. A sensitivity analysis was conducted, addressing specific elements of the analysis to show how the project can become economically feasible when adjusting investment, O&M and sales tariff. This research provides evidence on how the Waste-To-Energy (WTE) incineration industry is feasible in Mexico and provides significant benefits, not only by strengthening the renewable energy sector but also by significantly improving the waste management system.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction\nWaste incineration is increasingly used to reduce waste volume and produce electricity. Several incinerators have recently been proposed in Australia and community groups are concerned about health impacts. An overview of the evidence on health effects has been needed.\nMethod\nA systematic review of English language literature for waste incinerators and health using PRISMA methodology.\nResults\nA range of adverse health effects were identified, including significant associations with some neoplasia, congenital anomalies, infant deaths and miscarriage, but not for other diseases. Ingestion was the dominant exposure pathway for the public. Newer incinerator technologies may reduce exposure.\nDiscussion\nDespite these findings, diverse chemicals, poor study methodologies and inconsistent reporting of incinerator technology specifications precludes firmer conclusions about safety.\nConclusion\nOlder incinerator technology and infrequent maintenance schedules have been strongly linked with adverse health effects. More recent incinerators have fewer reported ill effects, perhaps because of inadequate time for adverse effects to emerge. A precautionary approach is required. Waste minimisation is essential.\nImplications for public health\nPublic health practitioners can offer clearer advice about adverse health effects from incinerators. We suggest improved research design and methods to make future studies more robust and comparable. We offer ideas for better policy and regulation.",

    "Abstract": "Sludge is often incinerated to achieve complete harmlessness and maximum capacity reduction, but the utilization of P (phosphorus) and the environmental pollution of F (fluorine) and Cl (chlorine) released from sludge incineration are usually ignored. In this paper, a series of experiments were employed to inquire into the conversion of various forms of P and the release of various forms of F and Cl after sludge incineration at different temperatures; the agriculture application prospect of P in sludge incineration ash and the environmental pollution caused by the release of F and Cl were discussed. The results show that P in sludge mainly exists as NAIP (non-apatite inorganic P) which biological effect was small. In the process of sludge incineration, InorgP (inorganic P) began to volatilize at 900 ℃, and the remaining P in sludge ash was 30.96 % at 1100 ℃. The forms of P in sludge incinerated at different temperatures varied considerably: a small amount of OrgP (organic P) in the sludge was converted into InorgP at 400 ℃; with the increase of incineration temperature, AP (apatite P) increased gradually, with 3.00 × 103–7.98 × 103 g/t in sludge ash at 700–1100 ℃. At 900 ℃, the content of AP in incineration ash was the highest, accounting for 58.98 % of Total P, which was the most suitable for slow-release phosphate fertilizer. At 600–1100 ℃, more Cl release, with a release rate of 50.61–92.70 %, among which the Cl for HCl (ClHCl) was 1.64 × 103–1.95 × 103 g/t at 700–1100 ℃. The F release rate was 1.52–37.39 %, among which the InorgF (inorganic F: mainly refers to F in HF and SiF4) was 1.13–27.91 g/t at 300–1100 ℃, the release amount of OrgF (organic F) was 1.59–1.86 g/t at 600–800 ℃. It can be seen that after incineration above 700 ℃, the sludge incineration ash may be used as a slow-release phosphate fertilizer, the release of Cl has greater environmental pollution and instrument corrosion than that of F, and the exhaust gas from sludge incineration cannot be discharged directly into the atmosphere.",

    "Abstract": "From the simple water wall incinerators of the late 19th century, the concept of waste-to-energy incineration has evolved dramatically. Initially, waste treatment had no energy recovery objective at all. To date, state of the art facilities exist and are coupled with not only mechanisms to recover heat and energy in combined heat and power plants, but sophisticated mechanisms to clean flue gas, utilize wastewater, and assimilate diverse streams of waste with high efficiency. This paper reviews the evolution of waste-to-energy incineration with the prime objective of evaluating progress made in solving problems, past and present concerns and future prospects in the industry. The review shows that waste-to-energy incineration has played a significant role in reducing the global waste problem and by maximizing its potential today, much more can be achieved. Nevertheless, the root problem notably the growing waste volume in today's society has not been fully addressed. An understanding of this evolution capacitates players in the waste-to-energy industry to better understand problems and formulate practical solutions which will steer waste to energy incineration towards more growth in the interim and devise lasting solutions for the distant future.",

    "Abstract": "With the upgrading of urbanization and improvement of living standards, the volume of municipal solid waste (MSW) is increasing in China. The waste-to-energy (WTE) incineration industry promotes the harmless disposal and recycling of MSW. It is an important part of the energy conservation and emission reduction tasks of “12th Five-Year Plan” period (2011–2015). Based on the development status of WTE plants in China, this paper makes an analysis of the WTE incineration industry from two aspects. The one is the analysis of political, economic, social and technological factors that influence the external environment of this industry. The other one is the discussion of technologies, costs and performances of some WTE plants in China, including a detailed cost-benefit analysis. It proves that the external environment is conducive to the development of WTE incineration industry and this industry is faced with good market prospects. Also, the net profit margin and return on investment (ROI) of WTE plants is attractive, up to 25% and 18% respectively. The pay back period is 12.73 years and the internal rate of return (IRR) is 10.94%. Thus, WTE plant has good profitability and economic benefit. Besides, WTE incineration has significant environmental benefits.",

    "Abstract": "Discussion about utilization of waste for energy production (waste-to-energy, WTE) has moved on to next development phase. Waste fired power plants are discussed and investigated. These facilities focus on electricity production whereas heat supply is diminished and operations are not limited by insufficient heat demand. Present results of simulation prove that increase of net electrical efficiency above 20% for units processing 100 kt/year (the most common ones) is problematic and tightly bound with increased investments. Very low useful heat production in Rankine-cycle based cogeneration system with standard steam parameters leads to ineffective utilization of energy. This is documented in this article with the help of newly developed methodology based on primary energy savings evaluation. This approach is confronted with common method for energy recovery efficiency evaluation required by EU legislation (Energy Efficiency—R1 Criteria). New term highly-efficient WTE is proposed and condition under which is the incinerator classified as highly efficient are specified and analyzed. Once sole electricity production is compelled by limited local heat demand, application of non-conventional arrangements is highly beneficial to secure effective energy utilization. In the paper a system where municipal solid waste incinerator is integrated with combined gas–steam cycle is evaluated in the same manner.",

    "Abstract": "The drivers for increasing incineration of sewage sludge and the characteristics of the resulting incinerated sewage sludge ash (ISSA) are reviewed. It is estimated that approximately 1.7 milliontonnes of ISSA are produced annually world-wide and is likely to increase in the future. Although most ISSA is currently landfilled, various options have been investigated that allow recycling and beneficial resource recovery. These include the use of ISSA as a substitute for clay in sintered bricks, tiles and pavers, and as a raw material for the manufacture of lightweight aggregate. ISSA has also been used to form high density glass–ceramics. Significant research has investigated the potential use of ISSA in blended cements for use in mortars and concrete, and as a raw material for the production of Portland cement. However, all these applications represent a loss of the valuable phosphate content in ISSA, which is typically comparable to that of a low grade phosphate ore. ISSA has significant potential to be used as a secondary source of phosphate for the production of fertilisers and phosphoric acid. Resource efficient approaches to recycling will increasingly require phosphate recovery from ISSA, with the remaining residual fraction also considered a useful material, and therefore further research is required in this area.",

    "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent chemicals and have been detected throughout the environment. Thermal treatment is the most common remediation approach for PFAS-contaminated solid wastes. Although various thermal treatment techniques have demonstrated the potential to destruct PFAS, the fate of PFAS, removal efficacy, potential emissions, and the formation of incomplete combustion products during thermal treatment are little known. This study provides a critical review on the behavior of PFAS based on different types of thermal treatment technologies with various PFAS-impacted environmental medias that include water, soil, sewage sludge, pure PFAS materials, and other PFAS-containing wastes. Different extents of PFAS thermal destruction are observed across various thermal treatment techniques and operating conditions. PFAS removal and destruction efficiencies rely heavily on PFAS structures, the complex combustion chemistry, the presence or absence of oxygen, temperature, and other operational conditions. This review also covers proposed PFAS thermal destruction mechanisms. Different thermal destruction mechanisms for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), and other PFAS are reviewed and compared. The majority of studies about PFAS thermal destruction mechanisms were focused on a specific list of PFAS and based mostly on the pyrolysis treatment. The basic pathway for PFAS destruction during pyrolysis is hydrodefluorination, which could be largely influenced by the alkaline condition. Future field-scale research that involves the characterization of PFAS destruction products and incomplete combustion products is needed to address public concerns and better emission control.",

    "Abstract": "Biochar is obtained by pyrolyzing biomass and is, by definition, applied in a way that avoids its rapid oxidation to CO2. Its use in agriculture includes animal feeding, manure treatment (e.g. as additive for bedding, composting, storage or anaerobic digestion), fertilizer component or direct soil application. Because the feedstock carbon is photosynthetically fixed CO2 from the atmosphere, producing and applying biochar is essentially a carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technology, which has a high-technology readiness level. However, for swift implementation of pyrogenic carbon capture and storage (PyCCS), biochar use in agriculture needs to deliver co-benefits, for example, by improving crop yields and ecosystem services and/or by improving climate change resilience by ameliorating key soil properties. Agronomic biochar research is a rapidly evolving field of research moving from less than 100 publications in 2010 to more than 15,000 by the end of 2020. Here, we summarize 26 rigorously selected meta-analyses published since 2016 that investigated a multitude of soil properties and agronomic performance parameters impacted by biochar application, for example, effects on yield, root biomass, water use efficiency, microbial activity, soil organic carbon and greenhouse gas emissions. All 26 meta-analyses show compelling evidence of the overall beneficial effect of biochar for all investigated agronomic parameters. One of the remaining challenges is the standardization of basic biochar analysis, still lacking in many studies. Incomplete biochar characterization increases uncertainty because adverse effects of individual studies included in the meta-analyses might be related to low-quality biochars, which would not qualify for certification and subsequent use (e.g. high content of contaminants, high salinity, incomplete pyrolysis, etc.). In summary, our systematic review suggests that biochar use in agriculture has the potential to combine CDR with significant agronomic and/or environmental co-benefits.",

    "Abstract": "Biochar is a carbon-rich solid formed from the organic residue by pyrolysis. The productivity of biochar relies on feedstock type and pyrolysis conditions. Studies on biochar were discussed relating its application and production as a source of soil remediation and bioeconomy. Pyrolysis conditions, gasification, hydrothermal carbonization were discussed in this study in obtaining biochar for remediation of soil. Biochar have made substantial breakthroughs in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, reducing soil nutrient leaching losses, sequester atmospheric carbon into the soil, increasing agricultural productivity, reducing bioavailability of environmental contaminants and subsequently, becoming a value-added product sustaining bioeconomy. Bio-economy implies the exploration and exploitation of bio-resources, which involves the use of biotechnology to create new bio-products of economic value. Biochar is a marketable bio-product, which can be used in agriculture, industries and energy sector. Thus, biochar production can enhance soil property and provide opportunities for additional income. This review presents the production, agronomic and economic benefits of biochar.",

    "Abstract": "Biochar—charcoal used to amend land and sequester carbon—is attracting considerable interest. Its distinctive physical/chemical/biological properties, including high water-holding capacity, large surface area, cation exchange capacity, elemental composition, and pore size/volume/distribution, effect its recognized impacts, especially on microbial communities. These are explored in the context of agriculture, composting, and land remediation/restoration. Considerable focus is given to mycorrhizal associations, which are central to exploitation in environmental technologies involving biochar. The characteristics of biochar, its availability for nutrient cycling, including the beneficial and potentially negative/inhibitory impacts, and the requisite multidisciplinary analysis (physicochemical, microbiological, and molecular) to study these in detail, are explored.",

    "Abstract": "Global warming and associated climate change are becoming a threat to almost all the ecosystems on the earth. According to the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) special report 2019, the global mean surface (land and ocean) temperature has been increased by 0.87 °C while mean of land surface air temperature has increased by 1.53 °C since 1850–2015. Climate change is affecting food security and human life due to warming, changing precipitation patterns, and the greater frequency of some extreme events. The main cause of global warming is the continuous increase in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) like CO2, CH4, N2O and fluorinated gases due to several anthropogenic activities. Therefore, reducing the increasing concentration of GHG is necessary to slow down global warming and climate change. Among several options of greenhouse mitigation, application of biochar into the soil is gaining popularity due to several advantages over other options. Biochar is a highly stable form of carbon derived from pyrolysis of biomass at relatively low temperatures. Application of biochar into the soil has been reported to provide multiple benefits like increase in crop yield, nutrient and water use efficiency and several environmental benefits. Recalcitrant nature, relatively higher carbon content and easily available feedstock make biochar a highly sustainable and quick option for carbon sequestration into the soil. Biochar application into the soil not only helps in carbon sequestration but also provides a better option for managing agricultural residues. The application of biochar has also reported for reducing a considerable amount of methane and nitrous oxide emission from the agricultural field due to its priming effect on the soil. Biochar yield, physical properties, and carbon content varies with the type of feedstock and pyrolysis condition. Therefore, the rate of carbon sequestration and mitigation of greenhouse gas is also highly variable, however, the biochar application ultimately leads to a positive contribution towards climate change mitigation. However, most of the reported benefits are confined to laboratory and field trial at institute level, widespread adoption of biochar on farmer’s field is still lacking. In the present chapter, all the aspects of biochar towards carbon sequestration and greenhouse mitigation have been well discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Innovation of sustainable materials that are efficient, economic, environmentally friendly, and socially acceptable for real-scale environmental applications is currently a trend in the scientific community. Recently, biochar as one of the main pyrogenic products from thermo-chemical process of ligno-cellulosic biomass has been widely studied to deal with water pollutants and wastewaters. Thus, there is an urgent need for the assessment of developed technologies to promote commercialization of the most sustainable technologies in order to identify the existing technical gaps. This review aims to identify current trends in the literature in order to evaluate the technology against sustainability considerations, emphasizing on the recently published reviews as well as the highly cited papers. The existing gaps and recommendations for future studies are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Approximately 600 million people lack access to safe drinking water, hence achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030) calls for rapid translation of recent research into practical and frugal solutions within the remaining 13 years. Biochars, with excellent capacity to remove several contaminants from aqueous solutions, constitute an untapped technology for drinking water treatment. Biochar water treatment has several potential merits compared to existing low-cost methods (i.e., sand filtration, boiling, solar disinfection, chlorination): (1) biochar is a low-cost and renewable adsorbent made using readily available biomaterials and skills, making it appropriate for low-income communities; (2) existing methods predominantly remove pathogens, but biochars remove chemical, biological and physical contaminants; (3) biochars maintain organoleptic properties of water, while existing methods generate carcinogenic by-products (e.g., chlorination) and/or increase concentrations of chemical contaminants (e.g., boiling). Biochars have co-benefits including provision of clean energy for household heating and cooking, and soil application of spent biochar improves soil quality and crop yields. Integrating biochar into the water and sanitation system transforms linear material flows into looped material cycles, consistent with terra preta sanitation. Lack of design information on biochar water treatment, and environmental and public health risks constrain the biochar technology. Seven hypotheses for future research are highlighted under three themes: (1) design and optimization of biochar water treatment; (2) ecotoxicology and human health risks associated with contaminant transfer along the biochar-soil-food-human pathway, and (3) life cycle analyses of carbon and energy footprints of biochar water treatment systems.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate gasification technologies and gasification of biomass for gaseous products. The gasification of biomass is a thermal treatment, which results in a high proportion of gaseous products and small quantities of char (solid product) and ash. At temperatures of approximately 873–1,273 K, solid biomass undergoes thermal decomposition to form gas-phase products that typically include H2, CO, CO2, CH4, H2O, and other gaseous hydrocarbons. Hydrogen gas was produced on a pilot scale by steam gasification of charred cellulosic waste material. The yield from steam gasification increases with increasing water to sample ratio. The yields of hydrogen from the pyrolysis and the steam gasification increase with the increase of temperature. In general, the gasification temperature is higher than that of pyrolysis and the yield of hydrogen from the gasification is higher than that of the pyrolysis.",

    "Abstract": "Biomass is an important primary energy source as well as renewable energy source. As the most promising biomass utilization method, gasification/pyrolysis produces not only useful fuel gases, char and chemicals, but also some byproducts like fly ash, NOx, SO2 and tar. Tar in the product gases will condense at low temperature, and lead to clogged or blockage in fuel lines, filters and engines. Moreover, too much tar in product gases will reduce the utilization efficiency of biomass. Therefore, the reduction or decomposition of tar in biomass derived fuel gases is one of the biggest obstacles in its utilization for power generation. In this paper, we review the literatures pertaining to tar reduction or destruction methods during biomass gasification/pyrolysis. On the basis of their characteristics, the current tar reduction or destruction methods can be broadly divided into five main groups: mechanism methods, self-modification, thermal cracking, catalyst cracking and plasma methods.",

    "Abstract": "From the conventional use of biomass in the form of heating to the modern day use of biomass in the form of electricity generation and biofuel production, biomass has always been part of the evolution of mankind. Modern day use of biomass is gradually becoming more complex, and engineering played an important role in defining different directions. This review provides an overall view of biomass utilization through thermal treatment including combustion, pyrolysis, and gasification. Efficient use of biomass with the desired output and minimizing the drawbacks are the core of the research, and marginal focus is being held on developing new techniques. The variety of composition and uptake of different elements throughout the lifespan of biomass produces a mixture of results. In general, it can be seen that the optimization was observed either in the form of chemical looping combustion to prevent greenhouse gas emission or in upgrading of bio-oil to produce biofuels. The significant factor is the reaction conditions, which define the ultimate product yield and the products’ performance in different applications. Moreover, the development of new systems is desired in the present scenario due to the limited possibility of further improvement in the current systems.",

    "Abstract": "The conventional biomass pyrolysis/gasification process for production of medium heating value gas for industrial or civil applications faces two disadvantages, i.e. low gas productivity and the accompanying corrosion of downstream equipment caused by the high content of tar vapour contained in the gas phase. The objective of this paper is to overcome these disadvantages, and therefore, the effects of the operating parameters on biomass pyrolysis are investigated in a laboratory setup based on the principle of keeping the heating value of the gas almost unchanged. The studied parameters include reaction temperature, residence time of volatile phase in the reactor, physico-chemical pretreatment of biomass particles, heating rate of the external heating furnace and improvement of the heat and mass transfer ability of the pyrolysis reactor. The running temperature of a separate cracking reactor and the geometrical configuration of the pyrolysis reactor are also studied. However, due to time limits, different types of catalysts are not used in this work to determine their positive influences on biomass pyrolysis behaviour. The results indicate that product gas production from biomass pyrolysis is sensitive to the operating parameters mentioned above, and the product gas heating value is high, up to 13–15 MJ/Nm3.",

    "Abstract": "A quantitative method for the determination of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) using liquid chromatography (LC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was developed and applied to aqueous wastewater, surface water, and drinking water samples. Fifty-three PFAS from 14 compound classes (including many contaminants of emerging concern) were measured using a single analytical method. After solid-phase extraction using weak anion exchange cartridges, method detection limits in water ranged from 0.28 to 18 ng/L and method quantitation limits ranged from 0.35 to 26 ng/L. Method accuracy ranged from 70 to 127% for 49 of the 53 extracted PFAS, with the remaining four between 66 and 138%. Method precision ranged from 2 to 28% RSD, with 49 out of the 53 PFAS being below < 20%. In addition to quantifying > 50 PFAS, many of which are currently unregulated in the environment and not included in typical analytical lists, this method has efficiency advantages over other similar methods as it utilizes a single chromatographic separation with a shorter runtime (14 min), while maintaining method accuracy and stability and the separation of branched and linear PFAS isomers. The method was applied to wastewater influent and effluent; surface water from a river, wetland, and lake; and drinking water samples to survey PFAS contamination in Australian aqueous matrices. The compound classes FTCAs, FOSAAs, PFPAs, and diPAPs were detected for the first time in Australian WWTPs and the method was used to quantify PFAS concentrations from 0.60 to 193 ng/L. The range of compound classes detected and different PFAS signatures between sample locations demonstrate the need for expanded quantitation lists when investigating PFAS, especially newer classes in aqueous environmental samples.",

    "Abstract": "Increasing production and use of chemicals and awareness of their impact on ecosystems and humans has led to large interest for broadening the knowledge on the chemical status of the environment and human health by suspect and non-target screening (NTS). To facilitate effective implementation of NTS in scientific, commercial and governmental laboratories, as well as acceptance by managers, regulators and risk assessors, more harmonisation in NTS is required. To address this, NORMAN Association members involved in NTS activities have prepared this guidance document, based on the current state of knowledge. The document is intended to provide guidance on performing high quality NTS studies and data interpretation while increasing awareness of the promise but also pitfalls and challenges associated with these techniques. Guidance is provided for all steps; from sampling and sample preparation to analysis by chromatography (liquid and gas—LC and GC) coupled via various ionisation techniques to high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS), through to data evaluation and reporting in the context of NTS. Although most experience within the NORMAN network still involves water analysis of polar compounds using LC–HRMS/MS, other matrices (sediment, soil, biota, dust, air) and instrumentation (GC, ion mobility) are covered, reflecting the rapid development and extension of the field. Due to the ongoing developments, the different questions addressed with NTS and manifold techniques in use, NORMAN members feel that no standard operation process can be provided at this stage. However, appropriate analytical methods, data processing techniques and databases commonly compiled in NTS workflows are introduced, their limitations are discussed and recommendations for different cases are provided. Proper quality assurance, quantification without reference standards and reporting results with clear confidence of identification assignment complete the guidance together with a glossary of definitions. The NORMAN community greatly supports the sharing of experiences and data via open science and hopes that this guideline supports this effort.",

    "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) constitute a large category of synthetic environmental pollutants, many of which remain unknown and warrant comprehensive investigation. This study comprehensively characterized PFASs in fluorinated-industrial wastewater by nontarget, quasi-target and target analyses using liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry and data-processing algorithms. The algorithms based on characteristic in-source neutral losses and isotopologue distributions were applied to screening and identifying PFASs, while semiquantitative and quantitative analyses were utilized to determine their concentrations and distributions in the wastewater. In total, 175 formulae of PFASs, including traditional, little-known and unknown species were identified and further ascertained in terms of concentrations and distributions. The total concentrations of PFASs in the wastewater were 5.3–33.4 μg mL−1, indicating serious pollution of PFASs. This study not only provides an efficient approach for screening and identification of unknown PFASs, but also presents a practicable and simple way to comprehensively depict environmental pollution signatures of PFASs.",

    "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large, complex group of synthetic chemicals that have been used in consumer products around the world since about the 1950s. They are ingredients in various everyday products. For example, PFAS are used to keep food from sticking to packaging or cookware, make clothes and carpets resistant to stains, and create firefighting foam that is more effective. PFAS molecules have a chain of linked carbon and fluorine atoms. Because the carbon-fluorine bond is one of the strongest, these chemicals do not degrade easily in the environment.",

    "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), that are widely used in different industrial and commercial activities, have become emerging contaminants of concern. Thus, the evaluation of PFAS presence in diverse environmental matrices is of paramount importance, leading to the necessity in development of different types of analytical methods to analyse the trace amounts of PFAS with varying selectivity and sensitivity. Analytical methods that have been advanced and employed for PFAS identification are critically described with their strengths, limitations and future potentials in this review. This review includes, (i) instrument analytical methodologies, mainly focusing on sample preparation, extraction and recovery analysis, (ii) nanoparticle-based sensors, and an app-based smartphone portable sensor, for the monitoring and sensing of PFAS in different environmental matrices. Furthermore, (iii) total oxidisable precursor assay (TOPA), content of total organic fluorine (TOF) as well as total fluorine (TF) are also reviewed, which provide fundamental tools towards achieving precursor quantification and closing mass balance analysis.",

    "Abstract": "A rapid on-line solid-phase extraction liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (on-line SPE-LC-HRMS) method was developed to analyze 11 ultra-short and short-chain PFAS in surface water. Analytical optimization involved screening 7 chromatographic columns and 5 on-line SPE columns, as well as evaluating SPE loading conditions, filters, sample acidification, chromatographic mobile phases, and SPE loading mobile phases. The optimized method was then applied to 44 river water samples collected in Eastern Canada, including sites near airports with fire-training areas. Among the 11 targeted PFAS, the most frequently detected were trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 4.6–220 ng/L), perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA, 0.85–33 ng/L), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA, 1.2–2100 ng/L), trifluoromethane sulfonic acid (TMS, 0.01–4.3 ng/L), and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS, 0.07–450 ng/L). Levels of C3-C5 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), C2-C4 perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) and n:3 polyfluoroalkyl acids (n = 2,3; n:3 acids) were significantly higher in water bodies near fire-training area sites compared with rivers in urban areas. In contrast, TFA, TMS, and 1:3 acid were not significantly elevated, likely reflecting atmospheric deposition or other diffuse sources for these compounds. Nontarget and suspect screening analysis revealed an abundance of other ultra-short and short-chain PFAS in AFFF-impacted water bodies. Perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides (FASA, C2, C3, and C5), perfluoroalkyl sulfonamide propanoic acids (FASA-PrA, C1-C2) and n:3 acids (n = 1, 4, and 5) were detected for the first time in environmental surface waters.",

    "Abstract": "The ubiquitous presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in various environments has led to increasing concern, and these chemicals have been confirmed as global contaminants. Following the chemical regulatory restrictions imposed, PFAS alternatives that are presumed to be less toxic have been manufactured to replace the traditional ones in the market. However, owing to the original release and alternative usage, continuous accumulation of PFAS has been reported in environmental and human samples, with uncertain consequences for ecosystem and human health. It is crucial to promote and improve existing analytical techniques to facilitate the detection of trace amounts of PFAS in diverse environmental matrices. This review summarizes analytical methods that have been applied to and advanced for targeted detection and suspect screening of PFAS, which mainly include (i) sampling and sample preparation methods for various environment matrices and organisms, and quality assurance/quality control during the analysis process, and (ii) quantitative methods for targeted analysis and automated suspect screening strategies for non-targeted PFAS analysis, together with their applications, advantages, shortcomings, and need for new method development.",

Recently non-targeted analysis (NTA) for the discovery of novel PFAS in environmental and biological media has been shown to be valuable in multiple applications. Classical targeted analysis for PFAS using LC-MS/MS, though growing in compound coverage, is still unable to inform a holistic understanding of the PFAS burden in most samples. NTA fills at least a portion of this data gap.",

    "Abstract": "Ammonia inhibition can be a major problem during anaerobic digestion of manure and municipal and industrial sludges. Anaerobic digestion is sensitive to higher NH3-N concentrations, which are inhibiting and at certain levels even toxic for methanogen bacteria. During anaerobic digestion, COD and BOD are converted for 60–80% into biogas. Nitrogen will only slightly be removed due to cell synthesis and due to hydrolysis most of the Kjehldahl nitrogen is converted to ammonium. Because of the reduction of COD in anaerobic digestion the effluent of the anaerobic treatment often results in a COD/N ratio which is too low for further aerobic nitrogen removal. The Nijhuis Ammonium Recovery system (NAR) can solve this problem and removes ammonium from digestate or other substrate for digestion. The NAR is a chemical process based on stripping of ammonia. The ammonium is recovered as ammonium sulphate, which can be used as a fertilizer for agricultural purposes. The NAR was proven to be a robust technology with a stable ammonium removal efficiency of 85–90% for anaerobic digested manure, municipal and other organic waste waters.The cost effectiveness mainly depends on the concentration of NH3-N in the influent, scale of the installation, the availability of residual heat and the local value and market for ammonium sulphate. Above 2 g/l NH3-N the NAR system is competitive and at higher NH3-N concentrations more cost efficient compared to other state of the art nitrogen removal technologies and ranges between 1–3 €/kg N.",

    "Abstract": "Anaerobic digestion is a technology, which converts biological wastes into biogas and biogas digestates (DIG); the latter is considered the main challenge for biogas producers. Recently, nutrient recovery technology from these DIG for bio-fertilizers production as an alternative for traditional chemical fertilizers is receiving increasing attention. This study aims to use two different biofertilizers based on DIG using ammonia striping technique which are liquid bio-based ammonium sulfate (BAS-L) and solid bio-based ammonium sulfate (BAS-S) fertilizers, besides the raw DIG and the conventional urea compound fertilizer (UCF) is used as a chemical fertilizer for comparison to produce solanaceous plants (eggplant). The agronomic effectiveness and economics of using these fertilizers are listed, and the results indicated that the eggplant yields using UCF and BAS-L were 62.65 tons/ha and 63.42 tons/ha, respectively, representing 24.5 % and 27.9 % higher than BAS-S and DIG, respectively. The agronomic efficiency (AEN) and the apparent recovery efficiency (AREN) of BAS-L fertilizer were the highest, reaching 44.8 kg DM/kg N and 7.9 %, respectively, which were significantly higher than the corresponding values of BAS-S and DIG. Furthermore, the economic benefits of various fertilizer applications were estimated and compared. The results showed that the theoretical net revenue of BAS-L fertilizer was 86065.03 $/ha, while BAS-S fertilizer and UCF were lower than BAS-L (56.7 % and 48.5 %, respectively), and the theoretical net revenue of direct application of DIG was 36958.95 $/ha. Therefore, BAS-L fertilizer has the best comprehensive fertilizer effect and economic benefits.",

    "Abstract": "Anaerobic digestion is a well-established technology that valorises organic wastes to produce renewable energy as biogas. The ammonia released during this process can be inhibitory if it exceeds a threshold concentration. Additionally, ammonia is a harmful environmental pollutant and also a renewable source of energy, thus establishing a need for the recovery of ammonia. Gas-liquid stripping is one such widely researched technology to recover ammonia from wastewater. However, there have not been any reviews focusing solely on the application of stripping to recover ammonia from the anaerobic digestate of organic wastes. This study reviews the current state of research in this field, focusing on the factors affecting the ammonia recovery, stripping column designs and linking of an anaerobic digester to a stripping column. An overview of the work done on the modelling of the ammonia stripping from digestate is also included. This review offers a direction for further research in this field; i.e., experimental and modelling studies on i) the effect of digestate composition on ammonia recovery and ii) the effect of stripping gas on ammonia removal.",

    "Abstract": "Development and optimization of nutrient recovery technologies for agricultural waste is on the rise. The full scale adoption of these technologies is however hindered by complex legal aspects that result from lack of science-based knowledge on characterization and fertilizer performance of recovered end-products. Ammonium sulfate (AS) and ammonium nitrate (AN), end-products of (stripping-)scrubbing technology, are currently listed by the European Commission as high priority products with the potential of replacing synthetic N fertilizers. The legal acceptance of AS and AN will be highly dependent on critical mass of scientific evidence. This study describes four different (stripping-)scrubbing pathways to recover ammonia with an aim to (i) assess product characteristics of ammonium nitrate (AN) and ammonium sulfate (AS) produced from different installations, (ii) evaluate fertilizer performance of recovered end-products in greenhouse (Lactuca sativa L.) and full field (Zea mays L.) scale settings and (iii) compare the observed performances with other published studies. Results have indicated that the recovered products might have a different legal status, as either mineral N fertilizer or yet as animal manure, depending on the used (stripping-)scrubbing process pathway. Nevertheless, no significant differences in respect to product characterization and fertilizer performance of AN and AS have been identified in this study as compared to the conventional use of synthetic N fertilizers. This indicates that recovered AS and AN are valuable N sources and therefore might be used as N fertilizers in crop cultivation.",

    "Abstract": "Phosphorus (P), an essential nutrient for all organisms, urgently needs to be recovered due to the increasing demand and scarcity of this natural resource. Recovering P from wastewater is a feasible and promising way widely studied nowadays due to the need to remove P in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). When enhanced biological P removal (EBPR) is implemented, an innovative option is to recover P from the supernatant streams obtained in the mainstream water line, and then combine it with liquor-crystallisation recovery processes, being the final recovered product struvite, vivianite or hydroxyapatite. The basic idea of these mainstream P-recovery strategies is to take advantage of the ability of polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAO) to increase P concentration under anaerobic conditions when some carbon source is available. This work shows the mainstream P-recovery technologies reported so far, both in continuous and sequenced batch reactors (SBR) based configurations. The amount of extraction, as a key parameter to balance the recovery efficiency and the maintenance of the EBPR of the system, should be the first design criterion. The maximum value of P-recovery efficiency for long-term operation with an adequate extraction ratio would be around 60%. Other relevant factors (e.g. COD/P ratio of the influent, need for an additional carbon source) and operational parameters (e.g. aeration, SRT, HRT) are also reported and discussed.",

    "Abstract": "We have critically assessed some of the dogmas in the microbiology of enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) and argue that the genus Tetrasphaera can be as important as Ca. Accumulibacter for phosphorus removal; and that proliferation of their competitors, the glycogen accumulating organisms, does not appear to be a practical problem for EBPR efficiency even under tropical conditions. An increasing number of EBPR-related genomes are changing our understanding of their physiology, for example, their potential to participate in denitrification. Rather than trying to identify organisms that adhere to strict phenotype metabolic models, we advocate for broader analyses of the whole microbial communities in EBPR plants by iterative studies with isolates, lab enrichments, and full-scale systems.",

    "Abstract": "The enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) process has been implemented in many wastewater treatment plants worldwide. While the EBPR process is indeed capable of efficient phosphorus (P) removal performance, disturbances and prolonged periods of insufficient P removal have been observed at full-scale plants on numerous occasions under conditions that are seemingly favourable for EBPR. Recent studies in this field have utilised a wide range of approaches to address this problem, from studying the microorganisms that are primarily responsible for or detrimental to this process, to determining their biochemical pathways and developing mathematical models that facilitate better prediction of process performance. The overall goal of each of these studies is to obtain a more detailed insight into how the EBPR process works, where the best way of achieving this objective is through linking together the information obtained using these different approaches. This review paper critically assesses the recent advances that have been achieved in this field, particularly relating to the areas of EBPR microbiology, biochemistry, process operation and process modelling. Potential areas for future research are also proposed. Although previous research in this field has undoubtedly improved our level of understanding, it is clear that much remains to be learned about the process, as many unanswered questions still remain. One of the challenges appears to be the integration of the existing and growing scientific knowledge base with the observations and applications in practice, which this paper hopes to partially achieve.",

    "Abstract": "In the present work, the bioaccumulation behavior of 49 target emerging organic compounds (20 perfluoroalkyl substances, PFASs, and 29 halogenated flame retardants, HFRs) was studied in soil invertebrates (Eisenia andrei). Multi species soil systems (MS·3) were used to assess the fate and the effects associated with the application of four biosolids in agricultural soil on terrestrial soil organisms. Biosolid amendment increased concentrations 1.5–14-fold for PFASs, 1.1–2.4-fold for polybrominated diphenyl ethers, PBDEs, and 1.1–3.6-fold for chlorinated flame retardants, CFRs. Perfluorooctanesulfonate, PFOS, (25%) and BDE-209 (60%) were the predominant PFAS and HFR compounds, respectively, in biosolids-amended soils. Total concentrations (ng/g dry weight) in earthworms from biosolid-amended soils ranged from 9.9 to 101 for PFASs, from 45 to 76 for PBDEs and 0.3–32 for CFRs. Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were calculated to evaluate the degree of exposure of pollutants in earthworms. The mean BAF ranged from 2.2 to 198 for PFASs, 0.6–17 for PBDEs and 0.5–20 for CFRs. The relationship of PFAS and PBDE BAFs in earthworms and their log Kow were compared: PFAS BAFs increased while PBDE BAFs declined with increasing log Kow values. The effect of the aging (21 days) on the bioavailability of the pollutants in amended soils was also assessed: the residence time affected differently to the compounds studied.",

    "Abstract": "While the recycling of wastewater biosolids via land-application is a sustainable practice for nutrient recovery and soil reclamation that has become increasingly common worldwide, concerns remain that this practice may become a source of toxic, persistent organic pollutants to the environment. This study concentrates on assessing the presence and the temporal trends of 12 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), pollutants of global consequence, in limed Class B biosolids from a municipal water resource recovery facility (WRRF), also know as a wastewater treatment plant. PFASs are of significant concern due to their extensive presence and persistence in environmental and biotic samples worldwide, most notably human blood samples. Class B biosolids were collected from the WRRF, prior to land-application, approximately every two to three months, from 2005 to 2013. Overall, this study found that concentrations of the 7 detectable PFAS compounds remained unchanged over the 8-year period, a result that is consistent with other temporal studies of these compounds in sewage sludges. From these analyzed compounds, the highest mean concentrations observed over the study period were 25.1 ng/g dw, 23.5 ng/g dw, and 22.5 ng/g dw for perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), respectively, and these compounds were detected at concentrations 2.5–5 times higher than the remaining, detectable PFASs. Furthermore, it was observed that PFOS, while demonstrating no overall change during the study, exhibited a visible spike in concentration from late 2006 to early 2007. This study indicates that concentrations of PFASs in WRRFs have been stagnant over time, despite regulation. This study also demonstrates that the use of glass jars with polytetrafluoroethylene-lined lids, a common storage method for environmental samples, will not influence PFOA and PFNA concentrations in archived biosolids samples.",

    "Abstract": "While drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) are not considered a source of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), PFAS concentrate in treatment residuals relative to their source water concentrations. Regulatory actions considered for PFAS-impacted residuals could affect the cost and viability of conventional residual management practices. This study estimated the annual quantity of residuals generated in the United States and presents a framework for understanding how PFAS may concentrate in these residual streams. Findings of this work indicate that PFAS may substantially impact DWTP residuals management, especially coagulation and softening solids, at concentration factors greater than 100 and spent adsorbents at PFAS concentration factors greater than 10,000. If potential regulatory actions were to apply to coagulation and softening residuals, those regulations must consider impacts on disposal of more than 420,000,000 wet tons of at-risk DWTP residuals which are generated annually.",

    "Abstract": "The “Biofactory” is a circular economy-based concept for wastewater treatment that improves water quality, promotes efficient use of materials and energy, while also recovering resources and decreasing both emissions and costs. Due to socio-economic bottlenecks, such as typical high costs and low public acceptance of novel resource recovery scenarios in wastewater treatment, realizing the Biofactory goals becomes a difficult task. Decision makers are currently unable to appreciate the environmental, social, and economic benefits of the Biofactory, as most decision-making tools focus on mainly technical and economic aspects. This is the first review is to use bibliometric analysis of publication trends in life cycle-based modelling for circular economies in wastewater treatment across the globe, focusing on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Life Cycle Costing (LCC) and Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA). The integration of LCA, LCC and SLCA for the development of a Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) decision making framework is recommended, while practical implications for the methodological development of this tool are compiled. The goal and scope of LCSA for the Biofactory must explore multi-product functional units for the recovery of different resources from wastewater, where system boundaries must include techno-environmental, social and economic systems together. Internal loops, feedbacks loops, avoided products and co-product allocation methodologies within the integrated system boundaries must be considered. Innovation is required for building LCA, LCC and SLCA inventories, where life cycle data management is important for implementing the Biofactory into the future.",

    "Abstract": "Recent studies of thermal PFAS destruction have reported seemingly incoherent temperatures and products, often because decomposition pathways are highly dependent on the respective experimental system. Here, we applied highly accurate DLPNO–CCSD(T) coupled cluster calculations to isolate and identify the major processes during thermal PFAS destruction in the gas phase, with relevance to incineration, thermal oxidation, and other thermal treatment technologies in which PFAS and their volatile decomposition products desorb into the gas phase. All investigated perfluoroalkyl acids decompose via unimolecular headgroup loss, either through HF elimination or homolytic bond cleavage as a function of headgroup type. In contrast, all investigated fluorotelomers undergo initial hydrogen abstraction from the characteristic C2H4 moiety by hydroxyl radicals under representative incineration conditions, followed by radical decomposition. Subsequent formation of perfluoroalkanes, including CF4, can then be prevented by supplying sufficient hydrogen donors such as hydrocarbon fuel and water as well as by scavenging released fluorine. This leads to the generation of stable 1H-perfluoroalkanes. While parent PFAS decomposition proceeds at gas-phase temperatures ≤700 °C, carbon–carbon cleavage of 1H-perfluoroalkanes requires up to ∼950 °C at 2 s gas residence time, making this step the kinetic bottleneck on the way to complete thermal PFAS mineralization.",

    "Abstract": "Robust monitoring and assessment methods are required to assess circular economy (CE) concepts in terms of their degree of circularity and their contribution to sustainability. This research aimed to develop an integrated framework for the CE context—considering both the technical circularity and the complexity of the three dimensions of sustainability (environment, economy, and social). Two existing methods were identified as an appropriate foundation: CE indicators and life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA), combining life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing (LCC), and social life cycle assessment (S-LCA). The developed circular life cycle sustainability assessment (C-LCSA) framework added circularity assessment (CA) as an additional dimension to LCSA (C-LCSA = LCA + LCC + S-LCA + CA). The abundance of CE indicators required a systematic selection process to identify the most appropriate indicators for the framework which was built on criteria levels, performance, loops, unit, dimension, and transversality. The material circularity indicator, product circularity indicator, and longevity indicator were identified as most suited for C-LCSA. Being developed for a single life cycle, the traditional life cycle approaches needed refinements for application to CE concepts, derived from discussions and proposed adaptions presented in the academic literature. The cut-off approach was identified as the most suitable end-of-life allocation method for C-LCSA, being in line with the technical system boundaries. C-LCSA can be used by LCA practitioners to identify trade-offs between an improved circularity and resulting impacts on the environmental, economic, and social pillars to provide a basis for decision making in industrial ecology.",

    "Abstract": "Solids from wastewater treatment undergo processing to reduce mass, minimize pathogens, and condition the products for specific end uses. However, costs and contaminant concerns (e.g., per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances [PFAS]) challenge traditional landfill and land application practices. Incineration can overcome these issues but has become complicated due to evolving emissions regulations, and it suffers from poor public perception. These circumstances are driving the re-emergence of pyrolysis and gasification technologies. A survey of suppliers was conducted to document differences with technologies. Both offer advantages over incineration with tailored production of a carbon-rich solid, currently less stringent air emission requirements, and lower flue gas flows requiring treatment. However, incineration more simply combines drying and thermal processing into one reactor. Equipment costs provided favor pyrolysis and gasification at lower capacities but converge with incineration at higher capacities. Long-term operational experience will confirm technology competitiveness and elucidate whether pyrolysis and gasification warrant widespread adoption. Practitioner Points Pyrolysis and gasification systems are gaining traction in the wastewater industry with several full-scale installations operating, in construction, or design Several advantages, but some disadvantages, are considered in comparison with incineration Organic contaminants, including PFAS, will undergo transformation and potentially complete mineralization through each process",

    "Abstract": "Traditional approaches for managing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) face significant limitations in cost, efficiency, and predictive capability, despite recent advances in monitoring and remediation technologies. While machine learning (ML) shows promise in environmental applications, its systematic implementation in PFAS management remains unexplored. This review synthesizes and evaluates recent advances in ML applications for PFAS management, addressing two key questions: (1) How effectively can ML predict PFAS contamination and identify sources? and (2) How can ML optimize PFAS removal technologies? Our methodology combines systematic literature review with two case studies, examining ML algorithm selection, implementation strategies, and performance metrics across PFAS applications. Results demonstrate that ML models achieve over 90 % accuracy in contamination prediction and source identification and improve treatment efficiency through automated parameter optimization. Our original contributions include: (1) developing a comprehensive framework for ML-enabled PFAS monitoring that integrates source identification and concentration prediction, (2) providing a systematic analysis of ML applications across PFAS treatment technologies, and (3) creating a roadmap for addressing critical challenges in data quality and model interpretability. We propose specific strategies for data standardization and model validation to accelerate real-world implementation of ML in PFAS management.",

    "Abstract": "Wastewater treatment generates solids requiring subsequent processing. Costs and contaminant concerns (e.g., per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances [PFAS]) are challenging widely used landfilling and land application practices. These circumstances are partly driving the re-emergence of pyrolysis and gasification technologies along with beneficial reuse prospects of the char solid residual. Previously, technologies experienced operational challenges leading to revised configurations, such as directly coupling a thermal oxidizer to the reactor to destroy tar forming compounds. This paper provides an overview of pyrolysis and gasification technologies, characteristics of the char product, air emission considerations, and potential fate of PFAS and other pollutants through the systems. Results from a survey of viable suppliers illustrate differences in commercially available options. Additional research is required to validate performance over the long-term operation and confirm contaminant fate, which will help determine whether resurging interest in pyrolysis and gasification warrants widespread adoption. Practitioner Points Pyrolysis and gasification systems are re-emerging in the wastewater industry. Direct coupling of thermal oxidizers and other modifications offered by contemporary systems aim to overcome past failures. Process conditions when coupled with a thermal oxidizer will likely destroy most organic contaminants, including PFAS, but requires additional research. Three full-scale facilities recently operated, several in construction or design that will provide operating experience for widespread technology adoption consideration.",

    "Abstract": "Studies on the destruction of solid per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) chemicals and PFAS-laden solid wastes significantly lag behind the urgent social demand. There is a great need to develop novel treatment processes that can destroy nonaqueous PFAS at ambient temperatures and pressures. In this study, we develop a piezoelectric-material-assisted ball milling (PZM-BM) process built on the principle that ball collisions during milling can activate PZMs to generate ∼kV potentials for PFAS destruction in the absence of solvents. Using boron nitride (BN), a typical PZM, as an example, we successfully demonstrate the complete destruction and near-quantitative (∼100%) defluorination of solid PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) after a 2 h treatment. This process was also used to treat PFAS-contaminated sediment. Approximately 80% of 21 targeted PFAS were destroyed after 6 h of treatment. The reaction mechanisms were determined to be a combination of piezo-electrochemical oxidation of PFAS and fluorination of BN. The PZM-BM process demonstrates many potential advantages, as the degradation of diverse PFAS is independent of functional group and chain configurations and does not require caustic chemicals, heating, or pressurization. This pioneering study lays the groundwork for optimizing PZM-BM to treat various PFAS-laden solid wastes.",

    "Abstract": "Over the past decade, there has been widespread concern about environmental contamination linked to an emerging class of compounds known as PFAS [Poly- and per-fluorinated alkyl substances]. PFAS contamination has been found in drinking water across the United States. Despite the increased interest within the scientific community, little research has been conducted on community environmental health concerns related to this emerging contaminant. This article analyses the case of PFAS water contamination in eastern North Carolina stemming from industrial production. Drawing from in-depth interviews, newspaper articles and government documents, we examine how uncertainty has permeated the case and influenced both official and community responses. Specifically, we analyse corporate and political officials’ production of 'coerced ignorance' surrounding PFAS and residents’ perception of environmental and health concerns under conditions of uncertainty. Implications for future research on PFAS contamination and other emerging contaminants are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are being studied in all environmental matrices because of their ubiquitous presence and adverse human health impacts. This study conducted a surveillance of 27 water resource recovery facilities throughout the United States and Canada to screen the range of PFAS concentrations in pre-stabilized sludge and post-stabilized product. Among the 27 water resource recovery facilities, 82% use anaerobic digestion and the rest use chemical stabilization and/or incineration for sludge stabilization. Forty PFAS compounds were evaluated by US Environmental Protection Agency Method SW846/537.1, and four and nine compounds were reported in the pre-stabilized sludge and post-stabilized product, respectively. Concentrations of reported compounds in pre-stabilized sludge and post-stabilized product varied from 5 to 33 ng/g dry basis and 2 to 220 ng/g dry basis, respectively. 3-Perfluoropentylpropanoic acid (5:3 FTCA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) were the most frequently observed compounds, and PFAS concentrations in the post-stabilized products were generally higher than the corresponding pre-stabilized sludge. Practitioner Points Among the 40 target PFAS, four were above reporting limit in the pre-stabilized sludge and nine in the post-stabilized product. Incineration ash (post-stabilized product) samples did not have any reportable PFAS. 5:3 FTCA and PFOS were the two frequently observed compounds; concentrations were higher in the post-stabilized product compared to the pre-stabilized sludge. PFPeA and PFHxA were the only two short chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids reported. PFOA was reported in only one of the 54 samples evaluated.",

    "Abstract": "Social equity has been a concept of interest for many years, gaining increased focus from energy and environmental communities. The equitable development, collection, and reporting of sociodemographic data (e.g., data related to socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicity) are needed to help meet several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (i.e., Affordable and Clean Energy; Reduce Inequalities; Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; and Partnerships for the Goals). Yet, there has not been a consolidation of relevant concepts and application framing in energy and environmental life cycle assessment and decision-making practices. Our study aims to help fill this gap by consolidating existing knowledge on relevant equity applications, providing examples of sociodemographic data needs, and presenting a path toward a more holistic equity administration. In this critique, we present a framework for integrating equity in energy and environmental research and practitioner settings, which we call systemic equity. Systemic equity requires the simultaneous and effective administration of resources (i.e., distributive equity), policies (i.e., procedural equity), and addressing the cultural needs of the systematically marginalized (i.e., recognitional equity). To help provide common language and shared understanding for when equity is ineffectively administered, we present ostensible equity (i.e., when resource and policy needs are met, but cultural needs are inadequately met), aspirational equity (i.e., when policy and cultural needs are met, but resources are inadequate), and exploitational equity (i.e., when resource and cultural needs are met, but policies are inadequate). We close by establishing an adaptive 10-step process for developing standard sociodemographic data practices. The systemic equity framework and 10-step process are translatable to other practitioner and research communities. Nonetheless, energy and environmental scientists, in collaboration with transdisciplinary stakeholders, should administer this framework and process urgently.",

    "Abstract": "Industry 4.0 is revolutionizing manufacturing processes and has a powerful impact on globalization by changing the workforce and increasing access to new skills and knowledge. World Economic Forum estimates that, by 2025, 50% of all employees will need reskilling due to adopting new technology. Five years from now, over two-thirds of skills considered important in today’s job requirements will change. A third of the essential skills in 2025 will consist of technology competencies not yet regarded as crucial to today's job requirements. In this study, we focus our discussion on the reskilling and upskilling of the future-ready workforce in the era of Industry 4.0 and beyond. We have delineated top skills sought by the industry to realize Industry 4.0 and presented a blueprint as a reference for people to learn and acquire new skills and knowledge. The findings of the study suggest that life-long learning should be part of an organization’s strategic goals. Both individuals and companies need to commit to reskilling and upskilling and make career development an essential phase of the future workforce. Great efforts should be taken to make these learning opportunities, such as reskilling and upskilling, accessible, available, and affordable to the workforce. This paper provides a unique perspective regarding a future-ready learning society as an essential integral of the vision of Industry 4.0.",

    "Abstract": "Conventional treatment methods are generally ineffective in removing PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) from liquid or solid streams in Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRFs). This poses a challenge for utilities, as the future regulation of PFAS is evolving, creating uncertainty in planning process upgrades. To support utilities and biosolids producers, this study evaluated several biosolids products (from 15 plants) through treatment process of composting (aerobic), thermal drying, and high temperature pyrolysis, all derived from non-industrially impacted sources. This study conducted an analysis of these products, focusing on the concentration of PFAS in the final products and the effectiveness of these treatment processes in reducing or eliminating PFAS from the initial feed solids. The composting results indicated that when sludge (waste activated sludge (WAS) or mixture of primary sludge and WAS) processed through liquid aerobic activated sludge treatment, the total concentration of the quantified PFAS in composting material was reduced by 9–20 % compared to raw sludge. In addition, when sludge processed through both liquid aerobic treatment and anaerobic digestion process, precursor transformation in composts is comparatively less compared to primary sludge. Samples (dewatered cake from primary sludge + WAS) collected from biological nutrient removal plant showed that reduction of PFAS compounds through the thermal drying system can be obtained with an average overall reduction of 15–31 %. In addition, a positive linear relationship was observed between thermal dryer inlet temperature and quantified PFAS reduction (high temperature indicates higher removal). A bench-scale pyrolysis setup was conducted on anaerobically digested dried solids which was pyrolyzed at 700 °C and achieved over 99 % PFAS mass reduction of measurable PFAS.",

    "Abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination of drinking water is now a critical environmental and public health concern. Conventional water treatment is ineffective, prompting investment in solutions like granular activated carbon, ion exchange, membrane filtration, foam-fractionation and electrochemical oxidation. However, selecting appropriate technologies involves trade-offs among performance, resource use and environmental impact criteria. Our analysis aims to offer new insights into the climate impacts per gram of PFAS removed and the annual capital and operational costs per volume water treated. We also highlight critical limitations of environmental assessment of PFAS treatments, particularly regarding toxicity-related impacts, that have not kept pace with developments in life cycle assessment methodology. Our analysis synthesizes data from 17 disparate publications on PFAS treatment technologies. Emissions from innovative treatments vary widely, with climate impacts ranging from 0.1 to 70 190 kg CO2 eq. per gram of PFAS depending on raw water PFAS concentrations. The economic analysis showed that operational costs span from $0.03/m³ to $28/m³, while capital expenditures range from $0.01 to $0.51/m³ of water treated and exhibit some economies of scale. This work also underscores the importance of using life cycle assessment and life cycle costing approaches to comprehensively evaluate PFAS removal technologies.",
